Emphasis  is  given on infotainment   equipment  and   services,  due   to   their  high complexity,    which   makes    advanced    dialogue   techniques necessary.  To this end,  leading-edge technologies  available to the   partners  of   the  consortium,   i.e.   continuous  speech recognition, speech synthesis, speaker identification, etc., will be integrated into a  prototype, which will be extensively tested and optimized.  The user of the  proposed system will  be able to initiate natural  spoken dialogues and ask  for information about the current status of any appliance and/or control it, requesting assistance on its use, etc.  Furthermore, he/she will be able, to use   the  connection   with  the   public  network,   to  access telecommunication voice services etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EPFL is involved in the \"Dialogue Interaction\" Work Package (WP): In this WP,  the dialogue component will be  set up. Multilingual Wizard of Oz (WoZ) experiments will be conducted to determine the dialogue flow for each language  that will be incorporated in the system.  A  dialogue  simulation   tool  will  be  developed  and additional user modelling functionalities will be incorporated to the dialogue component. The  dialogue and language models derived from the WoZ experiments will be used as bootstrap models for the dialogue  system.   Subsequently,  when  the system  is  set  up, utterances spoken  by users will  be recorded and  transcribed in order to improve the current dialogue and language models.</p>\r\n','2009-03-13 00:06:10',-1,'Jean-Cedric.Chappelier@epfl.ch'),(46,'Interactive Web Programmer','University of Glasgow','United Kingdom','2002-05-15','0000-00-00','\r\n<p>This is a shared post between GUIDE (Glasgow University Initiative in Distance Education) and the STELLA Project, (Software for Teaching English Language & Literature and its Assessment).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Job Purpose: The successful applicant will be based in GUIDE and will support the development of GUIDE\'s distance education programme at all levels and across the curriculum.

The appointment will be from January 2006 or as soon as possible thereafter. It is a permanent position. A Chair may be available if appropriate candidates present themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The appointment should be seen in the context of a longer-term aim to establish a critical mass of researchers interested in the digital humanities. The establishment of this post is the first step towards creating such a grouping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At least two major reports have emerged recently that signal a way forward for ICT in the humanities and arts (and social sciences). First, the AHRC Delivery Plan argues the need for greater capacity in \'grid technologies\', suggesting that research is needed in locating, accessing and integrating distributed resources that take the form of text, images and sound. Humanities Computing is therefore one of the key areas flagged in the Delivery Plan. There is already an ICT Methods Network funded by AHRC (and hosted by King\'s College London, in which Lancaster is involved as a partner institution) which aims to preserve and provide access to digital resources and to guide new developments and advanced methodologies. We wish Lancaster to play a leading part in both the Network and in driving forward this initiative more broadly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, the British Academy produced in May a report on \'E-resources for research in the humanities and social sciences\'. Among its recommendations are that Universities ensure that researchers have adequate access to technical support in this field and that such researchers promote the use of ICT where they can.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The creation of a new Faculty at Lancaster University provides a platform whereby an initiative in this area can be actively promoted and nurtured. Further, the University is keen to capitalise on the existing research base by establishing itself as a centre of excellence in the North West for ICT in the humanities and arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lancaster is involved in the following activities related to Humanities Computing (classified by Department); the list is skeletal and illustrative only:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Linguistics - and especially corpus linguistics, lexicography and historical linguistics; use of semantic tagging, applications to dictionary production Contemporary Arts (Music, Theatre, Art) - the use of new media in experimental performance; digital art installations, music software, computer representations of music English - applications to mediaeval theatre and manuscript studies, and to handling of material relating to Quakers in the North-West; Ruskinian materials; Chartist poetry; crime fiction History - digitising of calendar records, recent and contemporary oral history materials Institute for Cultural Research - cultural memory (oral histories)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Applicants should note that, from August 2005 there is a new Lancaster Institute for the Contemporary Arts (LICA) that merges three separate Departments (Art, Music and Theatre Studies).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Technical and equipment support</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some dedicated technical support will be provided to the post-holder.  The successful candidate will be invited to help determine, in consultation with others, the nature of this technical support and the equipment resources associated with this initiative. We have already been given an equipment grant to set up digitisation facilities. We intend that the successful candidate will develop a business plan for the use of such facilities, thereby creating an income stream to help further develop a programme of activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Departmental affiliation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The administrative location of the successful candidate will, initially, be at Faculty level. It is not presently envisaged that the candidate will be a member of an academic Department. This is to signal that the initiative is seen as a Faculty-wide one in which the post-holder helps to generate momentum across a range of potential stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Job description</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The successful candidate will, initially, be directly responsible to the Dean of the Faculty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Key internal contacts will be colleagues working in the host and cognate departments in the Faculty and outside, and in seeking to develop external funding the post-holder will be in close contact with other staff in the Faculty, including the Associate Dean for Research & Enterprise and the Research & Enterprise Support Officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Externally, we expect the post-holder to develop relationships with appropriate organisations and individuals therein, both regionally and nationally. Examples include the Research Councils (notably AHRC) and regional galleries and museums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Major duties will include:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Developing a research agenda, including the preparation of significant outputs for RAE2008 in an appropriate Unit of Assessment; working with others to establish new degree schemes, initially at postgraduate level, that are likely to recruit significant numbers of students; submitting applications for research funding to a range of funding agencies; liaising with external stakeholders (including museums, libraries and galleries) over their digitising needs; advising colleagues in humanities and social sciences on advanced research methods using ICT; helping to promote the use of advanced ICT throughout the University; helping to establish an international profile for Lancaster University in this field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post-holder will have flexibility to scope the development of the initiative. In particular, we would expect the post-holder to explore the possibilities for establishing a digitising service for the wider region as a means of helping to sustain the academic programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Person specification</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We seek a dynamic and committed researcher to help develop further the Faculty\'s interests in humanities computing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Essential requirements</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A PhD in a relevant research area.

The appointment will be from Summer 2006 and is a permanent position.</p>\r\n\r\nThe appointment should be seen in the context of a longer-term aim to establish a critical mass of researchers interested in the digital humanities. The establishment of this post is the first step towards creating such a grouping.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Background</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>At least two major reports have emerged recently that signal a way forward for ICT in the humanities and arts (and social sciences). First, the AHRC Delivery Plan argues the need for greater capacity in \'grid technologies\', suggesting that research is needed in locating, accessing and integrating distributed resources that take the form of text, images and sound. Humanities Computing is therefore one of the key areas flagged in the Delivery Plan. There is already an ICT Methods Network funded by AHRC (and hosted by King\'s College London, in which Lancaster is involved as a partner institution) which aims to preserve and provide access to digital resources and to guide new developments and advanced methodologies. We wish Lancaster to play a leading part in both the Network and in driving forward this initiative more broadly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, the British Academy produced in May 2005 a report on \'E-resources for research in the humanities and social sciences\'. Among its recommendations are that Universities ensure that researchers have adequate access to technical support in this field and that such researchers promote the use of ICT where they can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The creation of a new Faculty at Lancaster University provides a platform whereby an initiative in this area can be actively promoted and nurtured. Further, the University is keen to capitalise on the existing research base by establishing itself as a centre of excellence in the North West for ICT in the humanities and arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lancaster is involved in the following activities related to Humanities Computing (classified by Department); the list is skeletal and illustrative only:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nLinguistics -- and especially corpus linguistics, lexicography and historical linguistics; use of semantic tagging, applications to dictionary production Contemporary Arts (Music, Theatre, Art) -- the use of new media in experimental performance; digital art installations, music software, computer representations of music English -- applications to mediaeval theatre and manuscript studies, and to handling of material relating to Quakers in the North-West; Ruskinian materials; Chartist poetry; crime fiction History -- digitising of calendar records, recent and contemporary oral history materials Institute for Cultural Research -- cultural memory (oral histories)\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Technical and equipment support</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Some dedicated technical support will be provided to the post-holder.  The successful candidate will be invited to help determine, in consultation with others, the nature of this technical support and the equipment resources associated with this initiative. We have already been given an equipment grant to set up digitisation facilities. We intend that the successful candidate will develop a plan for the use of such facilities, thereby creating an income stream (from teaching, and from external sources) to help further develop a programme of activity.</p>\r\n<h4>Departmental affiliation</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The administrative location of the successful candidate will, initially, be at Faculty level. It is not immediately envisaged that the candidate will be a member of an academic Department. This is to signal that the initiative is seen as a Faculty-wide one in which the post-holder helps to generate momentum across a range of potential stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Job description</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The successful candidate will, initially, be directly responsible to the Dean of the Faculty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Key internal contacts will be colleagues working in the host and cognate departments in the Faculty and outside, and in seeking to develop external funding the post-holder will be in close contact with other staff in the Faculty, including the Associate Dean for Research & Enterprise and the Research & Enterprise Support Officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Externally, we expect the post-holder to develop relationships with appropriate organisations and individuals therein, both regionally and nationally. Examples include the Research Councils (notably AHRC) and regional galleries and museums.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Major duties will include:</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Developing a research agenda, including the preparation of\r\nsignificant outputs for RAE2008 in an appropriate Unit of Assessment; \" working with others to establish new degree schemes, initially at postgraduate level, that are likely to recruit significant numbers of students;\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>submitting applications for research funding to a range of funding agencies;</li>\r\n<li>liaising with external stakeholders (including museums, libraries and galleries) over their digitising needs; \" advising colleagues in humanities and social sciences on advanced research methods using ICT;</li>\r\n<li>helping to promote the use of advanced ICT throughout the University;</li>\r\n<li>helping to establish an international profile for Lancaster University in this field.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The post-holder will have flexibility to scope the development of the initiative. In particular, we would expect the post-holder to explore the possibilities for establishing a digitising service for the wider region as a means of helping to sustain the academic programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Person specification</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>We seek a dynamic and committed researcher to help develop further the Faculty\'s interests in humanities computing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Essential requirements</h4>\r\n<p>A PhD in a relevant research area. The precise disciplinary background of candidates matters less than a willingness to engage enthusiastically with academics from a range of disciplines, including, inter alia, English, Creative Arts (Theatre Studies, Art, Music), Linguistics, History, and Cultural Research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evidence of the use of advanced ICT, relating to the humanities or arts, in their own research</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A suitable track record of published work, commensurate with an entry to an appropriate Unit of Assessment for the next Research Assessment Exercise (2008).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evidence of an ability to take a leadership role for the area of ICT in the social sciences and arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Contact:</h4>\r\n\r\nProfessor Tony Gatrell<br/>\r\nDean, Faculty of Arts & Social Sciences<br/>\r\nLancaster University<br/>\r\nLancaster LA1 4YT<br/>\r\nUK<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nTel:  01524 510811<br/>\r\nemail: <a href=\"mailto:a.gatrell@lancaster.ac.uk\">a.gatrell@lancaster.ac.uk</a>','2009-03-13 00:15:32',-1,'willard.mccarty@kcl.ac.uk'),(189,'Senior Faculty Position in Humanities Computing','University of Alberta','Canada','2007-04-02','0000-00-00','\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Humanities Computing Programme (HuCo) and the Faculty of Arts at \r\nthe University of Alberta invite applications for a tenured \r\nappointment at the senior Associate or Full Professor level, \r\ncommencing 1 July 2008.

Formerly aligned with the Department of Art & Art History (AAH), VRC was recently transferred to the Stanford University Libraries & Academic Information Resources (SUL/AIR), where it operates under the supervision of the Art & Architecture Library.  The VRC has over 300,000 35 mm slides and 24,000 digital images and is engaged in both slide and digital image production. The collection covers all aspects of the study of art and architecture, especially Greek & Roman, European, American, Chinese and Japanese. The transfer of VRC into the SUL/AIR system provides numerous opportunities to leverage a department-based visual resource operation into a campus-wide service facility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The primary goals of the University -- teaching, learning, and research -- are centered on the accumulation and distribution of information among faculty, staff, and students, and the primary goal of the ATS is to support this mission through practical and creative uses of technology. An ATS position is multifaceted, and an ATS must be comfortable managing (juggling) a range of projects and duties that may include the development of complex web applications and/or databases on the one hand while assisting faculty in acquiring new technology skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ATS will play a central role in strategic planning and program development as VRC works to enhance and significantly expand its existing operation. The ATS will be responsible for leveraging technologies to achieve efficiencies in the digital production process, developing a back-up system for the imagebase, and designing a stable production platform from which to move forward. The recent incorporation of a Film and Media Studies program into AAH will require the addition of a digital video service for instructional support. The VRC will also need to expand its technological infrastructure to support the curricular requirements for the Electronic Media Arts program. As these VRC services grow, the ATS will be responsible for designing, developing and deploying the necessary technology solutions including a major initiative to network the imagebase, and provide VRC services online to the larger Stanford academic community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ideal candidate will have a record of innovation and creativity in leveraging technology to make resources accessible, understandable, and appealing to an academic audience and demonstrated leadership and resourcefulness in identifying and integrating technological solutions to research and pedagogical needs. The ability to work closely and respectfully with VRC staff, Art & Architecture Library staff, under the supervision of the Head of the Art & Architecture Library, in an extremely collegial, service-based, and forward-looking operation, is essential.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a full job description with detailed responsibilities and necessary qualifications, visit <a href=\"http://jobs.stanford.edu/find_a_job.html\">http://jobs.stanford.edu/find_a_job.html</a> and enter the job number, 22353 in the keyword search field.

It speaks to the\r\nconvergence of the NBIC sciences and to the redefinition of health care that\r\narises by describing ageing as a disease to be cured, rather than a natural\r\nprocess to accept. Biogerontology engages us with the prospect of extending\r\nhealth or life span to an unknown degree and, as such, it is a controversial\r\ndiscipline. Over the last ten years, work in this area has shifted from\r\nscientific impossibility to becoming a core part of scientific endeavour. A\r\nrange of media coverage, from aspersion to fascination, has accompanied this\r\nshift. In the literature on public understanding of science, there is no\r\nresearch yet attending to this distinct, but profound area of scientific\r\ninquiry. As such, this PhD studentship aims to explore the following\r\nquestions:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n   <li>How has biogerontology been articulated though the media?</li>\r\n   <li>What issues surround the political economy of research into\r\nlife-extension?<li>/\r\n   <li> How do different research communities orientate themselves around the</li>\r\nvarious media narratives on life-extension?\r\n   <li>How do journalists report research on biogerontology?</li>\r\n   <li>What can be learned from this subject area to broadly inform work into\r\nscience communication?</li>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Candidates should have a higher degree in science communication and\r\nqualitative research methods in media sociology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Director of Studies: Dr Andy Miah<br />\r\nExternal Adviser: Dr Aubrey de Grey\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The ethics of human enhancement in film (Ref.PHDMLM005)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies in the ethics of human enhancement have advanced considerably in the\r\nlast five years through the emergence of new communities of scholarly\r\ninquiry. A number of scientific disciplines have been brought under the\r\nspotlight due to their likely use for lifestyle, non-therapeutic purposes.\r\nThe connections between filmic narratives and bioethics are made manifest in\r\nrecent cultural studies and can be linked to broader, literary origins. Yet,\r\nthere is very little research that investigates the range of narratives that\r\nemerge on the ethics of human enhancement within film. This absence affects\r\nthe degree of complexity that is brought to how such debates are played out\r\nin the media and in policy. This PhD explores the contribution of film to\r\nsuch imaginations and aims to add complexity to our understanding of how\r\nfilm conveys such alterations. It should also help us understand how film\r\nfunctions as a posthuman device of expressing humanly experiences, such as\r\nprocess of remembering, perceiving and the possible disruption of sensory\r\nencounters. It also aims to explore the limitations of cultural reference\r\npoints within scientific policy making on the ethics of human enhancements,\r\nexploring the range of metaphors, analogies and stories that contribute to\r\nshaping the public understanding of science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Candidates should have a higher degree and particular expertise in film\r\ntheory and technological fiction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Director of Studies: Dr Andy Miah</p>\r\n\r\n','2009-03-13 00:39:20',-1,'email@andymiah.net'),(321,'Editorial Assistants','Comparative Literature and Culture','United States','2009-06-30','0000-00-00','\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Call for editorial assistants with CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and\r\nCulture (ISSN 1481-4374) http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/clcweb</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In keeping with the advantages of publishing scholarship online, the\r\ncommitment to peer-reviewed and open-access scholarship in the humanities\r\nand the social sciences, and the adjoining advantages of training and\r\nlearning in new media technology and scholarship, CLCWeb appoints advanced\r\ngraduate students and junior faculty to work with the journal as editorial\r\nassistants.
