Job Title:  Program Coordinator and Analyst, Anvil Academic Publishing 
Organization:  Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR)
Location:  Washington, DC 
Stipend:  $60,000 per year with health insurance for fellow
Start Date:  July 2, 2012

ORGANIZATION DESCRIPTION 
CLIR is an independent, nonprofit organization that forges strategies to enhance research, teaching, and 
learning environments in collaboration with libraries, cultural institutions, and communities of higher 
learning.  It seeks to:  1) foster new approaches to the management of digital and nondigital information 
resources so that they will be available in the future; 2) expand leadership capacity in the information 
professions; and 3) analyze changes in the information landscape and help practitioners prepare for them. 
CLIR and the National Institute for Technology in Liberal Education (NITLE), working with leading 
liberal arts colleges and universities, have launched a broad-based, collaborative publishing experiment 
that is scalable, widely adoptable, low-cost, and readily accessible by scholarly authors and readers. The 
project, called Anvil Academic Publishing, is a new digital academic publishing platform designed to 
address both the current crisis in academic publishing and the opportunities presented by digital 
technology, particularly the emergence of portable electronic reading/writing devices. The publishing 
platform is fully digital, with titles published on the Web and as apps on portable devices.  
POSITION DESCRIPTION 
The Program Coordinator and Analyst will have two related areas of responsibility: 1) program 
coordination, working closely with all aspects of the new publishing venture—peer review, editorial 
work, technical architecture, format/presentation of the scholarly end product, and the web 
environment—and 2) analysis of the various functions for optimal coherence and productivity. This 
position offers a unique opportunity to engage with new forms of scholarly expression and publishing 
methods.  Rigorous quality standards are requisite to the success of Anvil, as is ongoing adaptation to 
technological progress. The publishing paradigm is new, and will likely entail new definitions over time 
of evaluating credible scholarly discourse. This will in turn require thorough documentation, in as open a 
fashion as possible, of the process, progress, thinking, and vision. The program coordinator and analyst 
will be an invaluable addition to this sequence of activities. 
Working with the publisher, editor in chief, peer review boards, and the technology team, the Program 
Coordinator and Analyst’s activities will focus upon:  
• research and evaluation of available open-source and purchasable/licensable publishing platforms 
and programs (e.g., CommentPress, Digress.it, jiscpress.org, NINES’s Exhibit Builder, etc.), 
• working with NITLE Labs on building proof-of-concept Anvil prototypes,

• assisting with title production on prototype platforms, 
• developing demonstration title(s) showing the potential of Anvil, 
• exploring portable-device app publication possibilities, 
• serving as liaison with participating member institutions, 
• documenting workflow and efficacy of the Anvil enterprise. 
Additional duties will include: 
• outreach to digital humanities organizations, appropriate scholarly societies, leading thinkers, and 
participants in the digital scholarship space,  
• publishing articles about Anvil’s vision and plan in academic outlets,  
• providing updates and narrative in social media of Anvil progress. 
QUALIFICATIONS 
• Ph.D. in the humanities and humanistic social sciences.
• Current understanding of new technologies and forms of scholarly expression in digital 
humanities and in the technologies pertinent to current publishing experiment.
• Excellent research and analytical skills.
• Strong written and communication skills.
• Flexibility, initiative and good problem solving abilities.
• Ability to work independently and as a member of a team.
• Interest in enhancing the capacity of research universities and liberal arts colleges to serve society 
through innovative research and publishing models.
