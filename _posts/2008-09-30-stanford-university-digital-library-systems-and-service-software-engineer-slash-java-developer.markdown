transformation and management; service oriented library
cyberinfrastructure ("lyberstructure"); and digital asset & rights
management. This group works closely with peer teams focused on other
aspects of digital library functionality, including Web/UI application
development, in the creation of common and reusable technologies and
components. The successful candidate will be responsible for the
