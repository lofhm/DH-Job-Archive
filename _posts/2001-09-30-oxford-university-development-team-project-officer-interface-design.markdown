## Description


<p>The Humanities Computing Development Team (http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/hcdt/) was established in 1998 to provide IT project development services to support Humanities teaching and research at the University of Oxford. The Team is in the process of expanding to become the Academic Computing Development Team, a multidisciplinary unit that will cover all areas of academic study within the University. As part of this expansion we are looking to recruit an additional person to join our team. The post will initially be for one year.</p>

<p>You will work within the team on the development of internet-based applications to support teaching, learning and research at the University. You will specialise in the design of user interfaces for our projects. To do this you will need to be able to communicate successfully with people of differing technical expertise, including your other team members who are involved in the "back-end" technical development of the projects, and also our academic collaborators. As well as having excellent design skills, you will ideally have a good understanding of some of the more technical aspects of developing internet-based applications, and you will be keen to develop your skills further in these areas. Other duties will include application development, consultation with academic collaborators and researching and writing short reports about specific technologies.</p>

<p>We expect you to have a degree or equivalent qualification. You will have demonstrable practical experience in most of the following areas: graphic design, interface design, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the design and planning of large to medium sized websites. Experience of interfacing databases to the web and XML/XSLT are desirable but not essential skills, and an interest in online learning would be beneficial. The ability to work as part of a small team will be required, together with the organisational ability necessary to undertake and prioritise a variety of duties.</p>

<p>For both posts, please obtain further details and an application form from Mrs Nicky Tomlin, Oxford University Computing Services, 13 Banbury Road, Oxford OX2 6NN. (tel: 01865 273230, e-mail: nicky.tomlin@oucs.ox.ac.uk). Completed applications must be received by 12 noon on 27th September 2001</p>

<p>Informal enquiries should be directed to the Development Team Project Manager, Sophie Clarke (tel: 01865 283428, e-mail: sophie.clarke@oucs.ox.ac.uk).</p>

<p>The University is an Equal Opportunities Employer
