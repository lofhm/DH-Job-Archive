ILLC’s central research area is the study of fundamental principles of encoding, transmission and comprehension of information.

The candidate will bring a relevant and innovative research agenda in Digital Humanities and will be especially interested the development and application of digital methods in the humanities. Digital research corpora of literature, art, music and language are changing the humanities in a spectacular way, leading to new questions that seemed unanswerable until very recently. The Digital Humanities or e-Humanities transcend the individual humanities disciplines, and candidates will be at home in more than one discipline.

Apart from her/his involvement in the research area (e.g., by bringing researchers working on individual aspects of Digital Humanities together and acquire funding for these programmes), the candidate will play a role in teaching courses and in curriculum development in Digital Humanities and will be actively involved in PhD supervision. Furthermore, the candidate is expected to be an ambassador of the research theme and actively liaise and work with stakeholders both within and outside of the university sector.
