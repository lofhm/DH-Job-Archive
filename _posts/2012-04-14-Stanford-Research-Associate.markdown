##Description

The Literary Lab in the English Department seeks to fill a 75-100% FTE, one-year, fixed-term position (with possible renewal) in Digital Humanities and Computational Criticism, starting September 1, 2012. This position reports directly to the Faculty Director of the Lit Lab. The candidate is responsible for the coordination, implementation, and execution of various research projects.

The Lit Lab discusses, designs, and pursues literary research of a digital and quantitative nature. It is open to all students and faculty at Stanford and, on a more ad hoc basis, to students and faculty from other institutions. It engages in a variety of projects, ranging from dissertation chapters to individual and group publications, lectures, courses, conference panels, and even short books. Typically, research takes the form of a group experiment, and extends over a period of one or two years.


##Responsibilities

The candidate coordinates the Literary Lab research activities and projects, including workshops, tutorials, grant writing in consultation with the faculty Director and associated projects; and provides the needed programming support.

* Consults with faculty, post-doctoral and doctoral students on research projects
* Implements existing technology solutions and/or writes ad hoc software programs
* Parses and formats corpora to various forms of data visualization and analysis
* Serves as a co-author of research papers and other publications
* Teaches workshops as part of the Literary Lab's outreach
* Coordinates, trains, and supervises undergraduate research assistants
* Organizes conferences, including guest speakers and travel
* Attends and presents at conferences
* Assists with allocation of financial resources and provides financial tracking
* Produces required reports to external and internal funding sources

##Qualifications
A Ph.D. degree is required, with dissertation filing no later than August 2012. The work of the Literary Lab develops at the interface of Literary History and Computer Science and, therefore, qualified candidates may come from either discipline, though proficiency in both is highly desirable. Experience in text mining and/or corpus linguistics/natural language processing is required. Must possess expertise, familiarity, or willingness to learn computational techniques in humanities research, including software programs such as Tableau, Gephi, R, SPSS, TEI-XML, MySql, and Python. Candidates must have programming experience and must be eager to learn new software programs and adapt to the research projects of the Literary Lab as needed.

The work requires close collaboration with humanities faculty and researchers, therefore the candidate must have experience in coordinating diverse project teams, consisting of faculty, graduate and undergraduate students, and proactively work with all team members.


Qualified applicants should send 
1) a current curriculum vitae, 
2) a brief statement of research interests, and 
3) names and contact information of three references to Franco Moretti (moretti@stanford.edu) no later than **May 9, 2012.**
