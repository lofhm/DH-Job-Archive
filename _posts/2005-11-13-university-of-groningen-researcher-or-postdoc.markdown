Job description

The successful applicant will join the project ‘Linguistic determinants of mutual intelligibility in Scandinavia’ which is funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO). The aim of the project is to refine newly developed computational methods in order to quantify communicatively relevant similarity between closely related languages such as the Scandinavian languages. The similarity measurements will be used to develop a model for predicting and explaining mutual intelligibility. The candidate will cooperate closely with a PhD-student and a senior researcher. The full project description can be downloaded from: http://www.let.rug.nl/~gooskens/vidi.

Proficiency in one of the Scandinavian languages is a plus.

Conditions of employment
A salary from € 2191,- to € 4049,-  (based on a fulltime employment) depending on experience and qualifications.  
Duration of the contract: two years with a possible extension for one or two years subject to funding.
Hours per week: 32-40
The project will start on 1 January 2006 or as soon as possible after.
