## Description



<p>The Electronic Imprint of the University of Virginia Press publishes new digital scholarship via the World Wide Web, with underlying data stored primarily in XML. This position will require the candidate to analyze collections of richly tagged XML documents; design, write, and modify programs to search, query, retrieve and display them; and design HTML-based interfaces to the published texts. The successful candidate will have experience in creating and editing XML documents and in using a range of XML-related standards and technologies (DTDs, schemas, XPath, XSL), as well as good familiarity with standards-compliant HTML. Experience writing XSLT programs is strongly desired. The candidate must have a demonstrated ability to learn programming skills quickly, as this position will require use of the developing XQuery language. Experience in any or all of the following areas would be assets: Web design and programming technologies (especially CSS, Javascript, Java, PHP); high-level programming languages for text manipulation (especially Perl; or Python, Ruby); humanities computing, especially the Text Encoding Initiative; database programming (especially SQL, FileMaker Pro); Unix/Linux systems, including program installation and configuration, shell programming, editors and text utilities; manipulation of digitized images. The candidate must be capable of both team and individual programming, and should have strong communication skills and the ability to document his or her work in clear written English.</p>
