## Primary Function of Organizational Unit 	

The English Department at NC State offers a wide array of programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels: a B.A. in English (with concentrations in Creative Writing; Film; Language, Writing & Rhetoric; Literature, and Teacher Education), an M.A. in English (with concentrations in British & American Literature, Linguistics, Creative Writing, Rhetoric & Composition, and World Literature), an M.S. in Technical Communication, and an M.F.A. in Creative Writing. In partnership with NC State’s Department of Communication, the English Department also offers an interdisciplinary Ph.D. program in Communication, Rhetoric, and Digital Media.

## Essential Job Duties 	

The Department of English at North Carolina State University seeks to make a tenure-track appointment in Digital Humanities, rank and field open. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to help build the digital humanities curriculum in undergraduate and graduate programs in English and in the interdisciplinary doctoral program in Communication, Rhetoric, and Digital Media, and to develop NC State’s digital humanities presence across campus, in the technology-rich Research Triangle area, and with industry and foundation partners.

The candidate will join a department with an established track record of digital scholarship in fields including digital archives, virtual environments, textual editing and criticism, physical computing, and linguistics. In recent years, faculty have received funding in all of these areas from a number of public and private agencies. Our digital humanities initiatives are strongly supported by NC State’s College of Humanities and Social Sciences and by the NC State Libraries, which are nationally known for their excellence in providing innovative research support and data curation.

NC State University has special strengths in computer science and digital technology and is located in the Raleigh/Durham/Chapel Hill Research Triangle area, nationally recognized as a vibrant center for research and creativity. The James B. Hunt Library, opening this spring on our Centennial Campus, is being built from the ground up as a national model for the integration of technology, scholarship, and information storage, retrieval, and display.

The newly formed Research Triangle Digital Humanities Collaborative, a collaboration between NC State, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Duke University, and the National Humanities Center, offers further opportunities for research and curricular initiatives.

Duties include teaching graduate and undergraduate courses (2-2 base teaching load) as well as maintaining an active research and publication program and participating in professional and university service. There will be opportunities for leadership and program administration (with corresponding reductions in teaching load). We particularly welcome candidates whose research and teaching interests can help us develop one or more areas of existing strength within our department: creative writing, film, linguistics, literature, and rhetoric.
