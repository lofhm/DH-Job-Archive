We are seeking enthusiastic individuals with excellent technical development and project management skills to contribute to three Virtual Research Environment (VRE) projects over the next two years:</p> <ul><li>Building a Virtual Research Environment for the Humanities (BVREH) - determining the most effective ways to support national and international humanities research.</li><li>VRE for the Integrative Biology Research Consortium (IB VRE) - supporting the entire research process of a large-scale international research consortium.</li> <li>Sakai VRE Portal Demonstrator (Sakai VRE) - extending an open source, standards-based portal framework (led by Lancaster University with Oxford University as a key partner).</li></ul> <p>Further information about the projects and other opportunities available can be found via <a href="http://www.vre.ox.ac.uk/">http://www.vre.ox.ac.uk/</a>.</p> <p>The Humanities Division is one of the five academic divisions of the University of Oxford. Its subject areas include English, History, Classics, Philosophy, Modern Languages, Theology, Music and Fine Art. Humanities researchers at Oxford have been amongst the leaders in innovative use of ICT. The resources at Oxford provide an ideal testbed for a project to define and develop the potential benefits of a VRE for the national and international Humanities research community. An introduction to the Humanities Division can be found at <a href="http://www.humanities.ox.ac.uk/">http://www.humanities.ox.ac.uk/</a>.</p> <p>You will be responsible for technical services and support for the project and for the evaluation and implementation of demonstrator components for a Humanities VRE. You will be responsible for the online presentation of the project and have appropriate experience (including MySQL, PHP, XML, XHTML and CSS). You will also have Java programming skills and a familiarity with standards for portlets and portal frameworks. This post will be based in the Humanities Division, but will work closely with other members of the Oxford VRE community.</p> <p>Further particulars including details of how to apply can be obtained from Ms K. Brill, Classics Centre, George Street, Oxford OX1 2RL (tel: 01865-288385, email: karen.brill@classics.ox.ac.uk).</p> <p>The closing date is 18 March 2005. Interviews will be held in the second half of April 2005. Please indicate clearly if you would like to be considered for any of the other VRE posts in addition to your preferred post (on the understanding that your application may be shared across selection panels and you may be asked to submit further information or attend a second interview).
