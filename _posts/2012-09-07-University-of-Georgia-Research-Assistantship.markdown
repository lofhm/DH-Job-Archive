## Description:

#### PhD Research Assistantship on the Linguistic Atlas Project (LAP)

The LAP Research Assistantship (RA) is a training position: the successful candidate will be involved for 16 hours per week during the academic year in the daily operation of the LAP under the supervision of Professor Bill Kretzschmar, as part of the LAP collaborative research team. Tasks include archival management of historical survey materials in text and audio form, presentation of materials on the Web, and analysis of materials. All of these activities have strong digital components, so the successful candidate should have some experience and be comfortable with making Web sites, with basic scripting for management of files and analysis of language data, and with the use of common software for language study. The LAP RA will be expected to write a dissertation on some aspect of the LAP (e.g. field work, computing/GIS, complex systems, variationist analysis) under the direction of Professor Kretzschmar.

The RA will be paid at the standard University of Georgia rate at the PhD level (currently $15,400 for the academic year), plus tuition remission. Additional funding for summer hours may be available depending on grant funding. The RA is renewable annually for up to five years, given acceptable work performance at the LAP and progress towards degree. For the RA starting in mid-August 2013, the deadline for applications to the Graduate Program is December 1, 2012.

Candidates must apply to and be accepted into the PhD program in English at the University of Georgia. Admissions are highly competitive; requirements for application and admission are available at <http://www.english.uga.edu/grad/admission.html>. Students with an MA and students direct from the BA will both be considered. Candidates should discuss their interest in the LAP RA in the Personal Statement section of the application. Final offer of the LAP RA will be made by Professor Kretzschmar, and this can take place only after admission into the PhD program in English has been granted. PhD candidates in English are required to take coursework before the comprehensive exam (generally 27 hours, nine courses, after the MA), and will then conduct research towards the dissertation.  Programs of study are quite flexible in English so candidates can expect to follow their interests; however, the comprehensive exam will include at least one area of English literature as well as topics in English language and linguistics.

Prospective applicants should get in touch with Professor Bill Kretzschmar (kretzsch at uga.edu) to answer any questions and to determine the suitability of the applicant as a candidate for the RA. There is no special application for the RA beyond correspondence with Professor Kretzschmar and application to the PhD program in English. Complete information about the application process to the university and the English Department is available at <http://www.english.uga.edu/grad/admission.html>. Please note: the deadline for receipt of complete applications for the 2013-14 academic year is December 1, 2012.
