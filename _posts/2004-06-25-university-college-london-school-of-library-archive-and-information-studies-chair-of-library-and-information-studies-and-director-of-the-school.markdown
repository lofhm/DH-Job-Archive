## Description



<p>UCL invites applications for the Chair of Library and Information Studies in our School of Library, Archive and Information Studies. It is envisaged that the successful candidate will also be appointed to the post of the Director of the School, for an initial period of five years. The post will become vacant due to the retirement of Professor Susan Hockey, the present Director. The successful applicant will be a researcher of high international standing, and will have the relevant managerial skills and experience to lead this forward looking, interdisciplinary department. He or she will also be expected to participate in teaching at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The salary is negotiable on the professorial scale.</p>

<p>Further particulars concerning both the post and the School are available on the UCL website at <a href="http://www.slais.ucl.ac.uk/chair/">http://www.slais.ucl.ac.uk/chair/</a>. Informal enquiries may be made to Dr Rob Miller on 020 7679 2107 (international: +44 20 7679 2107), email: <a href="mailto:rsm@ucl.ac.uk">rsm@ucl.ac.uk.</a></p>

<p>Applications (10 copies for UK-based candidates, one copy for overseas candidates), including a curriculum vitae and the names and addresses of three referees (including at least one referee based outside the candidate's country of residence) and details of current salary, should be addressed to the Provost and President of UCL and sent to the Director of Academic Services, UCL, Gower Street, London WC1E 6BT.</p>

<p>We particularly welcome women and black and ethnic minority applicants as they are under represented at this level within University College London (Section 48 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975/38 of the Race Relations Act 1976 apply).</p>

<p>The closing date for applications is Friday 14 May 2004. It is intended that interviews for the post will be held on Tuesday 22 June 2004.</p>
