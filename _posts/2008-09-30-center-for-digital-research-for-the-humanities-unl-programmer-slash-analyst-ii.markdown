Qualifications: Required: Bachelor's degree in computing, computer

essential. Preferred: Background or interest in the humanities and
experience working with Unix O/S.

Salary: Salary range is $50,000 to $55,000 dependent upon the
qualifications of the successful applicant.

Application deadline: Applications will be accepted until the
position is filled, but applications received by May 30, 2008 will be
