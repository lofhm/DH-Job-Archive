The Atkins Library at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte aspires to national leadership in the field of digital scholarship and special collections, and to this end it seeks applications and nominations for a faculty appointment, Associate University Librarian for Special Collections. 

The AUL will continue the rapid growth Atkins' Special Collections Department (http://specialcollections.uncc.edu/) in its effort to support the creation, curation, and dissemination of digital, unique, and rare scholarship and cultural artifacts. The AUL will direct two units, the Digital Programs and Collections unit (DPaC), and the Digital Scholarship Lab (DSL) (http://dsl.uncc.edu/). 

The DPaC collects, curates, and makes available unique material of all kinds, including manuscripts, oral histories, government documents, university archives and historical maps. The DSL provides staff, equipment, and facilities that support faculty and graduate students in the production of digital scholarship. Open access is a foundational principle throughout Special Collections, and the AUL will be expected to contribute to local and national conversations that broaden awareness and build support on this issue. 

As the unit names imply, the AUL will lead a department that places a strong emphasis on special collections in digital formats. The successful candidate will possess a thorough understanding of the evolving nature of digital scholarship, perhaps from the perspective of a practitioner, but certainly spanning the full spectrum of its production, collection, use, and preservation. 

The AUL will choose and direct projects with the best potential to enhance teaching, research, and cultural capital, and apply exceptional entrepreneurial skills to attracting the grants and other external financial support that will help fund those projects. The AUL will also lead the planning for the construction of a new and expanded DSL facility, and the renovation and expansion of the DPaC spaces. 

Not all of the Department's work is digital, however. It actively builds and manages important print and manuscript collections, university archives, and the University Art Collection. The AUL will plan and coordinate large-scale expansion of these collections, with a concomitant growth in staff and equipment support. She or he will have a leadership role in the Library's gift collection building, and support its fundraising efforts. Finally, the AUL will serve as a strong partner with local and regional cultural memory organizations of all kinds, in addition to an outreach role that draws diverse communities to Special Collections and the University as a whole.
