# Assistant THATCamp Coordinator

*  [Original Link](http://thatcamp.org/03/23/were-hiring-an-assistant-thatcamp-coordinator/)

We’re now hiring an Assistant THATCamp Coordinator. The duties of this position will be to
* create, revise, and maintain support documentation for THATCamp organizers and participants, and
* assist with ongoing THATCamp support tasks such as creating THATCamp websites, reminding THATCamp organizers of pre- and post-THATCamp tasks, and answering questions by e-mail and Twitter about THATCamp.

This is a part-time, temporary position at no more than 10 hours per week for two years (April 2012 – March 2014) at a starting salary of $16 per hour. Work can be done remotely. The position is especially suited to a graduate student in a humanities discipline who is a THATCamp enthusiast.

We’ll hire someone who can do the following:
* Write clearly and concisely, especially when explaining technology to a general audience
* Build websites, preferably with WordPress (HTML, CSS, some PHP)
* Explain THATCamp and unconferences to scholars and others based on personal experience
* Work independently, completing tasks with minimal supervision
* Keep track of what’s going on at various events (THATCamps happen often)

Please send a résumé or a curriculum vitae and a couple of paragraphs about why you’re right for this position to Amanda French, THATCamp Coordinator, at info@thatcamp.org. We’ll begin reviewing applications April 1 and will let all applicants know the outcome by May 1.
