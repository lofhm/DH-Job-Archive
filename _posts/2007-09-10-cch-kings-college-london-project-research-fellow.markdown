## Description



<p>The Centre for Computing in the Humanities is a department with responsibility for its own academic programme and also a research centre promoting the appropriate application of computing in humanities research. In its latter capacity, it is looking for someone to assist with the technical research development in research projects. The projects cover a wide range of humanities disciplines, including medieval studies, history, literature and linguistics, and music, and also include a number of more general information management projects in both humanities and the social sciences.</p>

<p>The successful candidate to this position would be required to work with discipline specialists to analyse a wide variety of humanities materials and to model them using database and other highly-structured approaches; to design, write and modify programs to search, query, retrieve and display them; and to collaborate in the creation of integrated web-based interfaces to publish them.</p>

<p>Experience in design and building environments powered by relational database technologies is essential.  The department uses primarily Java and J2EE technologies to publish database materials on the web, and experience with these technologies is also critical.  Familiarity with standards-compliant XHTML and CSS and issues around accessibility is highly desirable, as is familiarity with XML and some of the emerging XML technologies that work with highly structured data such as XSLT 2.0 and XQuery.</p>

<p>Proven experience in creating integrated research applications using a range of technologies would be a significant advantage.</p>

<p>In addition you should have good understanding and experience of research in the humanities and you will need to be able to work effectively as part of a team, as well as independently. The successful candidate should have good communication skills and the ability to document their work in clear written English.</p>

<p>This appointment is on the RAII scale, currently ranging from £29,927 to £39,602 per annum plus of £2,323 London Allowance.</p>
