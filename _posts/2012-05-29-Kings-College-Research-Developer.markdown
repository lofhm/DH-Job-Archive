The Department of Digital Humanities (DDH), King's College London is looking for a highly motivated and technically sophisticated individual to work as a developer on the research project “Digital Resource and Database of Palaeography, Manuscripts and Diplomatic” (DigiPal). The position will involve designing and developing computer tools and methods to facilitate digital scholarship in the study of medieval and ancient handwriting and documents.

DDH has 13 established staff and 16 research staff working on research projects. It has generated over £17 million in research grants over the past 7 years and is involved in more than 30 major research projects, with funding from the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), the Leverhulme Trust and the Andrew W Mellon Foundation. DDH is responsible for the MA programmes in Digital Culture and Society, and Digital Humanities; it also runs undergraduate Digital Humanities modules.

Details	 The successful candidate for this position will have wide experience in modelling structured data and developing tools to search, query, retrieve and display them using relational databases and related technologies; in designing, writing and modifying programs which facilitate content creation; and collaborating in the development of integrated interfaces for web publication.

Experience in creating and manipulating structured data with a range of RDB-related and web-delivery standards and technologies (SQL, Django/Python, Javascript/JQuery) is essential. Familiarity with ontologies, text processing techniques and standards-compliant XHTML and CSS is highly desirable, as is experience in the modelling of humanities data, especially that relating to manuscripts and documents.

In addition you will need to have an understanding of how research is conducted in the humanities and social sciences and you will be expected to make a contribution to the departmental research profile.
