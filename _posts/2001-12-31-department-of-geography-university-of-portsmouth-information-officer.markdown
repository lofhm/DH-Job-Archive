## Description


<p>GREAT BRITAIN HISTORICAL GIS PROJECT</p>
<p>NOF-Digitise</p>
<p>Since 1994, the Great Britain Historical GIS Project has been assembling a large database of historical statistics about places in Britain, now holding over 30m. data values, and mapping the changing administrative geographies to which these data relate. New funding of Â£620,000 from the New Opportunities Fund is enabling us to extend this collection to include historic maps and travellers' descriptions of places, create more systematic metadata and make the whole resource web-accessible to life-long learners. We are collaborating with the British Library, the National Council on Archives and the English Heritage thesaurus programme.  See:</p>

<p>This post is for someone qualified in librarianship, information science or similar subject.  Our team also includes Geographical Information Systems specialists, a database officer, local historians and a substantial data entry unit.  Your role will include creating a cataloguing system for our large and growing digital collection, ensuring compliance with developing metadata standards and researching user needs. By the project's end you'll have contributed very visibly both to a resource used by life-long learners throughout Britain and to international standards for digital libraries.</p>

<p>Training in GIS technology is NOT required, but an existing interest in maps and other geographical information would be an advantage, as would experience of basic web authoring.  A thorough grounding in the principles of library science is essential.</p>

<p>Some overseas travel will be required as the project will be collaborating with two major US projects.  Firstly, the National Historical GIS, who are developing a detailed standard for documenting tabular data; see:</p>

<p>and:</p>

<p>Secondly, the Alexandria Digital Library, who have created a gazetteer content standard:</p>

<p>Our gazetteer will both provide access to our own holdings and serve as an on-line authority list nationally.</p>
