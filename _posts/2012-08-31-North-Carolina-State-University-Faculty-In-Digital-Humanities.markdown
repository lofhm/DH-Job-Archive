* NC State University: Open Rank Tenure/Tenure Track Faculty in Digital
Humanities
* Position Vacancy Number: 00002010

## Description

The Department of English at North Carolina State University seeks to make
a tenure-track appointment in Digital Humanities, rank and field open. The
successful candidate will have the opportunity to help build the digital
humanities curriculum in undergraduate and graduate programs in English and
in the interdisciplinary doctoral program in Communication, Rhetoric, and
Digital Media,  and to develop NC State’s digital humanities presence
across campus, in the technology-rich Research Triangle area, and with
industry and foundation partners.

The candidate will join a department with an established track record of
digital scholarship in fields including digital archives, virtual
environments, textual editing and criticism, physical computing, and
linguistics. In recent years, faculty have received funding in all of these
areas from a number of public and private agencies. Our digital humanities
initiatives are strongly supported by NC State’s  College of Humanities and
Social Sciences and by the NC State Libraries, which are nationally known
for their excellence in providing innovative research support and data
curation

NC State University has special strengths in computer science and digital
technology and is located in the Raleigh/Durham/Chapel Hill Research
Triangle area, nationally recognized as a vibrant center for research and
creativity.  The James B. Hunt Library, opening this spring on our
Centennial Campus,  is being built from the ground up as a national model
for the integration of technology, scholarship, and information storage,
retrieval, and display.

The newly formed Research Triangle Digital Humanities Collaborative, a
collaboration between NC State, the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill, Duke University, and the National Humanities Center, offers further
opportunities for research and curricular initiatives.

## *Position Description:* 

Duties include teaching graduate and undergraduate
courses (2-2 base teaching load) as well as maintaining an active research
and publication program and participating in professional and university
service. There will be opportunities for leadership and program
administration (with corresponding reductions in teaching load). We
particularly welcome candidates whose research and teaching interests can
help us develop one or more areas of existing strength within our
department: creative writing, film, linguistics, literature, and rhetoric.

## Qualifications:

Required -- Ph.D. in English or related field, area
open; track record of excellence in digital scholarship appropriate for
rank.  
Preferred -- a history of successful grant funding in the digital
humanities.
