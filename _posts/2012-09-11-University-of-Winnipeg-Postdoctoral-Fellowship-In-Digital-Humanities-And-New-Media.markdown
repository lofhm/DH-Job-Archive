## Description:

The Institute for Women’s and Gender Studies (IWGS) at the University of Winnipeg invites applications for a half time Postdoctoral Fellowship in Digital Humanities and New Media starting as soon as possible, and lasting up to two years.
The successful candidate should have received a PhD within the last three years or have a defense date set at the time of application.
The IWGS practices and fosters participation in collaborative feminist work, research and activism within all of our communities. We are a working partner of the Department of Women’s and Gender Studies at the University of Winnipeg. We strive to develop the creative and transformative potential of the university, community and society through removing barriers to, and promoting the exchange of, knowledge between the institution and its communities (<www.iwgs.ca>).

##General Duties:

* The IWGS Postdoctoral Fellow will consult and collaborate with faculty members on digital and new media projects. 
* S/he will also be expected to develop and publish original research. 
* The IWGS is in the process of building HIVE (Hub for InnoVative Exchange) and the Postdoctoral Fellow will be central to its development and success.

HIVE is a partnership between the Women’s and Gender Studies Department at the University of Winnipeg (hereafter WGS) and IWGS. This research partnership works to expand traditional humanities knowledge practices through the innovation of digital environments. By incorporating digital advancements in collaboration, visualization, social media and dissemination, we will use our research to productively explore and gauge the impact of digital media in community building. In particular, we will experiment with, and innovate within, the rapidly evolving tools of social media and networking, to examine how digital media can enhance and encourage research, artistic mobilization, and public engagement.
Eventually, HIVE will become a multi-purpose performance, exhibition, training, and consultation facility that works with interdisciplinary teams including individual artists, community members, academics, and undergraduate and graduate students and their organizations in developing, implementing, and disseminating research in theoretical and applied components. Understanding our research as critically and simultaneously within and beyond the academy, we build on existing partnerships worldwide.

## Qualifications:

* The ideal candidate will have a PhD in Women’s and Gender Studies or a related field and a research program that includes extensive work within the digital humanities and new media fields. 
* S/he should also have experience in project management and be comfortable managing research assistants and coordinating deadlines and projects.
* S/he should have extensive experience with digital scholarship projects and initiatives, advanced humanities research experience, technology skills, subject expertise, and strong written and verbal communication skills.
#### Experience with some or all of the following is desired: 
* Wordpress 
* Omeka or other CMS 
* Data visualization tools and methods 
* Programming (ideal)
