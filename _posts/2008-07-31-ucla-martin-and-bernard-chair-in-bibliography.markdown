## Description


<p>The Information Studies Department at the University of California, Los
Angeles, announces an opening for the newly created Martin and Bernard
Breslauer Chair in Bibliography (see
http://is.gseis.ucla.edu/jobs/breslauer_announcement.pdf ). <p>Endowed
Chairs at UCLA are reserved for distinguished scholars and teachers at
the Full Professor level. It is expected that the Breslauer Professor
will contribute to the long-standing leadership and innovation in all
areas of bibliography of the Information Studies Department, here
understood to include: the study of the collection and description of
books and other textual works; the study of the production and use of
textual works as physical objects; and the history of the book, of book
arts, and of print culture. Emergent areas in which the Department is
also interested include: the history of transitions from print to
digital formats, and of the impact of such transitions on the book arts,
on publishing and access systems, and on reading; the design of
bibliographic systems that offer scholars in the arts and humanities
access to creative and intellectual works; and approaches to the study
of bibliographic collection and description that are informed by
artistic and humanistic perspectives. For more information, see our
website: http://is.gseis.ucla.edu/.</p>
