## NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES
 
The NCSU Libraries has a well-earned reputation for creating adventurous library spaces and innovative services that delight today’s students and researchers. The D. H. Hill Library combines the best of tradition and innovation, housing special collections and a beautiful gallery alongside vibrant, experiential spaces such as the Learning Commons and Technology Sandbox. Soon we will open a magnificent new library that promises to be nothing less than the best learning and collaborative space in the country. Located on NC State’s Centennial Campus, the James B.
