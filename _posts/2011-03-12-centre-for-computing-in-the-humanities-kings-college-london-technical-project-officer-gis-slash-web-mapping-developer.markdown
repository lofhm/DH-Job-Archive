## Description

<p>The Centre for Computing in the Humanities (CCH) wishes to recruit a developer specialising in GIS & web-based mapping to work with and support the CCH development team and subject discipline specialists across a range of research projects, many of which will involve spatial data and map-based visualisation.</p>

<p>As part of its very active research programme, the Centre (a department within the School of Arts and Humanities) is involved in a large number of externally funded collaborative research projects, almost all of which are published as freely available websites. The department has built and hosts some 140 such websites, of which around 35 are in active development at any one time. The successful candidate will be involved in supporting web application development on existing and new projects, focussing primarily on those involving underlying spatial data, and the visualisation of data on both static and interactive web-based maps.</p>

<p>Applicants should have extensive experience with GIS, and will have worked with ESRI ArcGIS and / or Open Source GIS editors; applicants must also have development experience with PostgreSQL and/or MySQL and will be comfortable working in SQL. Applicants will require a thorough working knowledge of the standards and protocols associated with the storage and interchange of spatial data (i.e. WMS, JSON, GeoRSS, KML, XML), together with a strength in at least one web programming language (preferably J2EE/JSP, Django, or PHP) and the willingness and capability to learn other languages as required. The ability to program in JavaScript ('pure', or using a framework) and experience with AJAX development, are essential for this role as is competence with XHTML and CSS. Familiarity with Open Source mapping servers such as GeoServer and MapServer would be highly desirable.</p>

<p>Candidates must be able to demonstrate experience in a GIS analyst or web development role elsewhere. A background or interest in the cultural heritage sector and/or the fields of the Humanities or Social Sciences would be an advantage. </p>

<p>The successful candidate will need to be able to work effectively as part of a collaborative team as well as being able to work independently. They should have good communication skills and possess the ability to document work in clear written English.</p>

<p>The appointment will be made, dependent on relevant qualifications and experience, within the Grade 6 scale, currently £33,070 - £39,038, per annum, inclusive of £2,323 London Allowance, per annum. Benefits include an annual season ticket loan scheme and a final salary superannuation scheme.</p>

<p>The closing date for receipt of applications is 11 March 2011</p>

<p>(Full-time, fixed term 2 years - Grade 6)</p>
