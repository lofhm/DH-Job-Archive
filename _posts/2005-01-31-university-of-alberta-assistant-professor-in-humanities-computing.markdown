## Description



<p>
FACULTY OF ARTS<BR>
The University of Alberta<BR>
Edmonton, Alberta, Canada<BR></p>

<p>The Faculty of Arts, University of Alberta, invites applications for a full-time continuing position, at the Assistant Professor level, commencing July 1, 2005, in the area of Humanities Computing.  This position will integrate into the existing M.A. in Humanities Computing programme, now into its fourth year.  The successful applicant will be associated with an allied department in the Faculty, and some related undergraduate teaching will be expected.</p>

<p>The M.A. programme emphasizes computing research methods and critical thinking in the liberal arts and provides students with appropriate technical skills to equip them well either for further study or for careers in information management.  Students in this programme develop a firm grasp of the fundamental principles of computing methods in the humanities, an understanding of how these methods contribute to restructuring or transforming the disciplines, and an appreciation of the potential of these methods for revisioning applications in computer science.  Graduates are qualified to bridge the territory between computer specialist and project director or manager.  More information on the M.A. in Humanities Computing is available at <a href="http://huco.ualberta.ca/">http://huco.ualberta.ca</a></p>

<p>Applicants will present demonstrated evidence of excellence in the conduct, reporting, and dissemination of research on the application of cutting edge approaches to humanities disciplines.  Principal areas of investigation may include: knowledge representation; visual communication design; new media; hypertext; text corpora; text encoding and analysis; computational linguistics; statistical models; and broad library and research-based work that focuses on significant issues of textuality; interfaces; and information browsing and retrieval. In short, applicants should be involved in work that offers innovative and substantial applications and uses for humanities computing-based teaching, research and practice.</p>

<p>An application package, including: a letter of application; a curriculum vitae; copies of undergraduate and graduate transcripts; and the names, institutional addresses and email addresses of three references who have been invited to write on the applicantâ€™s behalf, should be sent to:</p>

<p>Dr. Rick Szostak, Associate Dean (Academic) Faculty of Arts, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2E5, Phone: 780-492-9132 Email:  <a href="mailto:rick.szostak@ualberta.ca">rick.szostak@ualberta.ca</a>.

<p>The closing date for applications is:  January 14, 2005.</p>

<p>All qualified candidates are encouraged to apply; however, Canadians and permanent residents will be given priority. The University of Alberta hires on the basis of merit.  We are committed to the principle of equity in employment.
