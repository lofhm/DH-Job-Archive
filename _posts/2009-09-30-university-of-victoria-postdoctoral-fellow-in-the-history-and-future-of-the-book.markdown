## Description

<p>The Implementing New Knowledge Environments (INKE) project seeks a post-doctoral fellow in digital humanities with expertise in textual studies. This position is based in the Electronic Textual Cultures Lab at the University of Victoria. The successful candidate is anticipated to work
closely with team members at U Victoria, U Toronto, Acadia U, U
Saskatchewan, U Western Ontario, and beyond.</p>

<p>The postdoctoral fellow will work with digital manifestations of historical
textual features, collaborating with those associated with INKE's textual studies team and others, consulting with project stakeholders and potential
stakeholders, and liaising with other INKE researchers located in North America and the UK.</p>

<p>The successful candidate will have skills and aptitudes in
humanities-oriented research, textual studies and book history/bibliography,
including training or demonstrated experience working with a variety of
digital humanities resources, including digital archives, scholarly
editions, journals and monographs, and text analysis and visualization
tools.  Organizational skills are essential. Interest and aptitude in
research planning and management would be an asset. The ability to work in
concert with our existing team is a critical requirement.</p>

<p>Examples of technologies employed in related INKE projects are as follows:
TEI P-5 ; XML, XSLT, XSL and XHTML encoding; XQuery; eXist XML databases;
JavaScript; and Ruby on Rails.  Experience in some or all technologies in
use in INKE-related project and similar areas would be an asset, but is not
a requirement, though aptitude with digital tools is required.</p>

<p>Our current team members pride themselves on a passionate interest in both
the humanities and their computational engagement. Our ideal candidate is
someone with similar passions who can introduce the team to new ideas and
provide new perspectives on existing digital humanities issues.</p>

The salary for this position is competitive in the Canadian context, and is
governed in part by SSHRC practices. Applications comprising a brief cover
letter, CV, and the names and contact information for three referees may be
sent electronically to etcl-apply@gmail.com . The contract can begin as
early as 1 September 2009; it is for a one-year term, with the possibility
of renewal.

<p>Interviews are anticipated to take place in June at the Digital Humanities
Summer Institute, the Digital Humanities 2009 conference, and other venues
at which INKE team members are present.  Applications will be received and
reviewed until the position is filled.</p>
