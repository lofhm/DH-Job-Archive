## Description


<p>The Department of Computational Linguistics, Saarland University is seeking to fill two research positions in the areas of Computational and Experimental Psycholinguistics. Persons taking up the positions will be involved in a newly funded project entitled: "Adaptive Mechanisms for Human Language Processing". The project aims to develop wide-coverage, probabilistic models of human language processing, as informed by evidence obtained from large corpora, and both on-line and off-line psycholinguistic experiments.</p>
</p>
<p>1. Computational Linguist: experience in the development of probabilistic models of language processing. In particular, we are interested in developing incremental models of syntactic and semantic processing. Knowledge of one or more of the following is desirable: probabilistic parsing techniques, machine learning of natural language, connectionist language modelling, and experience working with large corpora.</p>
</p>
<p>2. Experimental Psycholinguist: experience in designing, running and analysing psycholinguistic experiments, and familiarity with (some of) the following paradigms: self-paced reading, eye-tracking (fixed or head-mounted), language production, and web-based experiments.</p>
</p>
<p>Candidates should have research experience in a relevant subject area, and ideally will hold a PhD. The position is on the BAT IIa scale (roughly up to DM 80K per annum, depending on age and family status) and is tenable for 3 years with the possibility of renewal.</p>
</p>
<p>The positions are available from January 1st, 2002.  Applications received before November 1, 2001 are assured fullest consideration. Interested persons should send a letter of application giving contact details for three possible referees and a full CV to (e-mail applications are also welcome):</p>

<p>The Department offers state of the art research facilities including head-mounted and DPI eye-tracking equipment, powerful Unix servers for statistical modeling, and an extensive corpus infrastructure. Saarland University has an international profile in computational linguistics, cognitive science and computer science. Research is supported by a European Graduate School for "Language Technology and Cognitive Systems" (joint with Edinburgh University) and a Centre of Excellence (SFB 378) in the area of "Resource Adaptive Cognitive Processes".</p>
</p>
<p>The University of Saarland seeks to increase the proportion of women in positions where they are under-represented, and therefore particularly encourages applications from women. In the selection procedure, disabled persons with equivalent qualifications will be favoured.</p>
