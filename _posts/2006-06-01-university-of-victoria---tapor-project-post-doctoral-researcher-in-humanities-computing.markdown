## Description



<h3>Post-Doctoral Researcher in Humanities Computing</h3>
<p>A new one year, fixed-term appointment will become available July 1st, 2005, for a suitably qualified Post-Doctoral Researcher to work with the University of Victoria’s Text Analysis Portal for Research (TAPoR) Project, based in the Humanities Computing and Media Centre (HCMC) at the University of Victoria. <p>
<p>About TAPoR: TAPoR is building a unique human and computing infrastructure for text analysis across the country by establishing six regional centers (UMcMaster, UMontreal, UAlberta, UNew Brunswick, UToronto, and UVictoria) to form one national text analysis research portal. This portal will be a gateway to tools for sophisticated analysis and retrieval, along with representative texts for experimentation. The local centers will include text research laboratories with best-of-breed software and full-text servers that are coordinated into a vertical portal for the study of electronic texts. Each center will be integrated into its local research culture and, thus, some variation will exist from center to center. <p>
<p>TAPoR at the University of Victoria’s HCMC has a multimedia laboratory and server infrastructure suitable for research into a variety of areas of Humanities Computing, including multimedia enrichment and acquisition, text representation and text analysis.  UVic’s newly appointed CRC Chair in Humanities Computing, and our resident computing experts, provide guidance and expertise to the 8+ TAPoR-related research projects currently under development.  To learn more about UVic people and projects, see <a href="http://web.uvic.ca/hrd/tapor/index.htm">http://web.uvic.ca/hrd/tapor/index.htm</a>.   <p>
<p>Suitable candidates interested in this position will bring established academic research questions in an area of Humanities Computing, as well as demonstrated capability to implement solutions to those questions using the technologies supported by TAPoR at UVic.    <p>
<p>Examples of technologies supported by TAPoR at UVic are: XML, XSLT, and XSL:FO encoding languages; TEI P4 and P5; XQuery; and eXist XML databases.  In addition, UVic TAPoR project members frequently work with XHTML, JavaScript and CSS, and web-based SQL database projects using PostgresSQL and mySQL.  <p>
<p>A full job announcement detailing submission requirements, deadlines, and salary guidelines, will be posted shortly on the Human Resources home page at the University of Victoria.<p>
<p>Please contact Scott Gerrity (sgerrity@uvic.ca or 250-721-8787), HCMC Coordinator, for further information.<p>
