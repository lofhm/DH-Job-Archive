Position open in "big data" with relationship to crowdsourcing, social computing, visualization, visual analytics, individual and group behavior, ubiquitous computing.

The Department of Human Centered Design & Engineering at the University of Washington invites applications for a full time tenure track Assistant, Associate, or Full Professor. We are seeking a top caliber researcher and teacher to join our growing and dynamic department. We are interested in candidates whose research is outstanding in quality and originality, and who possess expertise in human centered aspects regarding the use of big data. We are particularly interested in researchers who unite the study of massive and complex data sets with the study of crowdsourcing, visualization, visual analytics, individual and group behavior, social computing, interactive design, and/or ubiquitous computing. We are also interested in candidates who engage critically with theory in their research. This faculty member will be joining a growing interdisciplinary community of engineers, social scientists, computer scientists, and humanities scholars at the University of Washington interested in the emerging frontier of big data.

We will consider candidates from a range of disciplinary backgrounds who use innovative methodological, computational, or theoretical approaches to address current challenges in human centered design and engineering. HCDE is an interdisciplinary community that incorporates a range of research traditions. More information about our department can be found at <http://hcde.washington.edu>. The successful candidate is expected to develop a substantial program of research including peer-reviewed publications and external funding.

The department is seeking applicants at the Assistant Professor level, although an appointment may be made at the rank of Associate or Full Professor if circumstances and qualifications warrant. Applicants must have an earned doctorate by the date of appointment.

HCDE offers BS, MS, and PhD degrees. The candidate will teach undergraduate and graduate courses and will supervise doctoral dissertations. The yearly teaching load is three courses (one per quarter) plus supervision of research groups. Teaching opportunities will be based on current course offerings and the individualâ€™s areas of scholarly expertise.

The successful candidate will join a vibrant faculty conducting interdisciplinary research in human-computer interaction and the design of sociotechnical systems. Current faculty research includes work in CSCW, sociotechnical systems, HCI, computer-mediated communication, ICTD, user research, emerging communication technologies, engineering design, scientific collaboration, and engineering education. The department collaborates with colleagues around campus, including Computer Science and Engineering, the Information School, the eScience Institute, and the School of Art. The faculty also routinely engage in research projects with affiliates from the region's noted high-tech industry. Seattle is home to many prominent technology companies, along with a robust startup and global health community.

The University of Washington is building a culturally diverse faculty and strongly encourages applications from women and minority candidates. The University is an affirmative action, equal opportunity employer. The University of Washington, a recipient of the 2006 Alfred P. Sloan award for Faculty Career Flexibility, is committed to supporting the work-life balance of its faculty. University of Washington faculty engage in teaching, research, and service.

Appointment begins in autumn 2013, contingent on budgetary approval. Review of applications will begin **November 7, 2012**. Priority will be given to applications received by November 28.

To apply, send (1) a letter of application, (2) a current cv, and (3) a statement of research and teaching goals to <mailto:hcdefac@uw.edu>.
