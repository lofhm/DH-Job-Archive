## Description


<p>The Arts and Humanities Data Service (AHDS) is a national service funded by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) and the Arts and Humanities Research Board (AHRB), to collect, manage, catalogue, preserve and promote the use of digital resources in research, teaching and learning in the arts and humanities. The AHDS provides advice and guidance in the creation of digital resources to quality standards that ensure their suitability for use in research and teaching and their long-term viability. The AHDS is a distributed service with five subject centres providing services for archaeology, history, literature, language, linguistics and textual studies, performing and visual arts, and a managing Executive at King's College, London. Applicants are advised to consult the AHDS web site for further information: <a href="http://ahds.ac.uk">http://ahds.ac.uk</a></p>

<p>The AHDS is seeking to appoint a Collections Manager to implement the AHDS strategic objectives for collections development and management. The Collections Manager will play a pivotal role in establishing and managing common standards, practices and procedures for the preparation of AHDS collections for inclusion in AHDS on-line dissemination systems, and off-line preservation systems, and in ensuring consistent practice and quality standards across the AHDS. Working closely with information professionals, funding bodies and academic researchers, the Collections Manager will lead and coordinate the work of the AHDS in setting standards and best practice for data and metadata creation, and researching data creation methodologies. S/he will play a lead role in promoting and encouraging the take-up of these standards and best practice by data creators, and in the provision of advice and guidance on standards, methodologies, and procedures for data deposition. S/he will be encouraged to contribute to national and international development of standards, methodologies, models and practices for data creation, collections management and preservation.</p>

<p>The ideal candidate will be a dynamic, well-organised graduate with a degree in an arts or humanities subject and extensive practical experience of creating and managing digital collections in a research or archival context. Experience of using digital collections in research, teaching or learning would be an asset. A good knowledge and understanding of standards and protocols for creating digital collections is essential and knowledge of preservation standards and protocols would be useful, as would knowledge of metadata standards such as Dublin Core. S/he must be capable of demonstrating leadership, successfully implementing and managing change, and communicating effectively at all levels.</p>
