## Description

<h2>Digital Environments/Digital Humanities</h2>
<b>Rank: Assistant Professor</b>
<br />
<br />
The University of Michigan's School of Information (SI) seeks an outstanding tenure-track faculty member at the Assistant Professor level to help establish a vigorous program of research and teaching in Digital Environments/Digital Humanities. New technologies and digital environments offer transformative opportunities for the humanities. At the same time, they bring unheralded challenges for accountability, authority, representation, intelligibility, and the assessment of value. Candidates for this position should have a demonstrated research record investigating topics of concern in the digital humanities. Potential areas of research include (but are not limited to) virtual collaboration in the humanities; design of interactive humanities-related media; credibility and authority of digital content; ethnography or history of digital culture; and curation of digital resources. 
<br />
<br />
This position is part of a Digital Environments faculty cluster aimed at transforming humanities scholarship and engaging faculty and students in new modes of research, teaching, and learning. The Digital Environments cluster represents a partnership between the School of Information; the departments of English Language and Literature and Communication Studies; and the Program in American Culture, each of which is hiring a new faculty member through independent searches. Candidates for the School of Information position will engage with these new faculty as well as colleagues across the university, through such venues as research projects, a speaker series, reading groups, and teaching initiatives.
<br />
<br />
Application letters for this position must discuss the candidate's ideas for interacting with the cluster group. Before doing so, please read the <a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/about-SI/digital_environments_description.htm">full description of the Digital Environments cluster</a>.
<br />
<br />
The mission of the School of Information, where this position will reside, is to connect people, information, and technology in more valuable ways. The School is home to a dynamic and vibrant research and teaching program, with 35 FTE faculty, 49 doctoral students, and 404 students in its professional program, the Master of Science in Information. In partnership with other units, we recently launched a new undergraduate informatics major. The School of Information is internationally recognized for its research strengths in social informatics, network analysis and text mining, human computer interaction, digital archives, cyberinfrastructure, digital preservation, and information seeking, sharing and use. More about the School, its vision, and its activities can be found at the School's website: <a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/">si.umich.edu</a>
