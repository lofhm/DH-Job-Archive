<p class="hft-paras">* About the Scholarly Technology Group</p>

<p class="hft-paras">The Brown University Scholarly Technology Group (STG) provides
advanced technology consulting to Brown humanities faculty,
departments, libraries, and research centers primarily through large
and small projects in support of scholarly work in the digital
medium. We also explore the critical new technologies that are
transforming scholarly work and helping to maintain its longevity:
data and metadata standards, XML publication tools, text encoding
methods, new media forms, and accessibility standards. STG has three
staff members: the Director, a Senior Research Programmer, and a
Research Programmer. STG also employs between 3 and 5 student
programmers and designers; students who are domain experts often
contribute to projects.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">* Women Writers Project</p>

<p class="hft-paras">The Brown University Women Writers Project (WWP) is a long-standing
digital research project focused on developing and publishing an
online research collection of early women’s writing. Since 1988 the
WWP has been engaged in discovering, collecting, transcribing,
encoding, and publishing rare texts by women for use in research and
teaching. The WWP collection, published online since 1999 as Women
Writers Online, is widely used in the USA and internationally. The
project itself has been recognized as a leader in research on
scholarly text encoding, and provides consulting, training, and
research support to digital projects and individual scholars at Brown
and many other institutions. The WWP group includes three staff
members: the Director, the Senior Programmer/Analyst, and the Project
Manager/Textbase Editor. The project also employs a group of between
5 and 10 graduate student encoders.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">* Digital Humanities at Brown University</p>

<p class="hft-paras">At Brown, the digital humanities have a long history which includes
groundbreaking work in fields as disparate as hypertext, text
encoding, linguistic corpora, and computer graphics. Digital support
groups, long-standing research projects, and individual faculty
members now make up a thriving community for research, discussion,
instruction, and development. The Library’s Center for Digital
Initiatives focuses on digitizing important and distinctive library
collections whose content lends itself to digital dissemination. The
CDI also addresses institution-wide issues in digital research
including metadata standards, digital repositories, and the long-term
archiving and preservation of digital materials. The Scholarly
Technology Group supports digital humanities research through its
faculty grants program, through seminars and public lectures, and
through the research of its staff. Research projects like the Women
Writers Project, the Modernist Journals Project, the Virtual
Humanities Lab, and many others work closely with the CDI and STG.</p>
