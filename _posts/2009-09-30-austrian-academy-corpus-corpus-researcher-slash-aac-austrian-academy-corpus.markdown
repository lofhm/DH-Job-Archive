innovative methods in exploiting middle to large sized text corpora

(preferably PhD) in computer science, informatics, corpus
linguistics, general linguistics or any other discipline in the
humanities with a research focus on IT related issues and has strong
programming skills (preferably C++, Delphi and/or scripting
languages). Ideally, he/she has a background in applied research
making use of written textual resources, has experience with applied
research on textual data, and has an international research track
record and publication record in the field.</p>

<p>How and where to apply: The AAC - Austrian Academy Corpus
(http://www.aac.ac.at/) is a research department based within the
Austrian Academy of Sciences, which is mainly funded by the Austrian
Federal Ministry of Science and Research, and is situated in the
historic centre of Vienna (Austria). Interested applicants should
