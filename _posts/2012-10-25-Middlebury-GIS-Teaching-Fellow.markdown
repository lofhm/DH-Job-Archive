## Description: 
The Geography Department at Middlebury College invites applicants for a newly created GIS Teaching Fellows Program, designed to encourage the expansion of GIS instruction across the liberal arts curriculum.  We seek recent doctoral recipients or advanced ABD candidates from any academic discipline who have applied GIS in their doctoral research and have demonstrated excellence in undergraduate teaching. Middlebury’s GIS Teaching Fellows will be appointed to a nine-month term, to begin in September 2013. In the fall semester, Fellows will assist Geography Department faculty in teaching the department’s Fundamentals of GIS course. In addition, Fellows will participate in a weekly seminar focused on GIS pedagogy, during which each Fellow will develop a new GIS-based course related to his or her area of expertise. In the spring semester, the Fellows will jointly teach the Fundamentals course and their own newly developed courses. Teaching Fellows will be expected to be resident at Middlebury College from September through May.

###Application Instructions

Review of applications will begin **November 1** and continue until the position is filled. Middlebury College uses Interfolio to collect all faculty job applications electronically. Email and paper applications will not be accepted. Through Interfolio, please submit a letter of application addressed to Professor Jeff Howarth, Teaching Fellows Search Chair, along with a current curriculum vitae, a one- to two-page description of a new GIS-based course with an applied or disciplinary focus, and three letters of recommendation, at least two of which address teaching ability.
