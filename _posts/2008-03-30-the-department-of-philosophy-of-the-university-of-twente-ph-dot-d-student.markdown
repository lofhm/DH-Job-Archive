## Description





<p>The Department of Philosophy of the University of Twente in the
Netherlands is looking for a
Ph.D. Student (M/F, full time)
for the project “Cultural, Political and Religious Ideologies and the
Appraisal of New Media”
</p>
<p>
The PhD position is part of a prestigious and exciting international
research project in philosophy named “Evaluating the Cultural Quality of
New Media”. This five-year project, which includes six researchers and
involves collaboration with leading international scholars and research
centres, has as its aim to develop a framework for better normative
analyses of new media and new media culture, especially in relation to
their contribution to the quality of life (“the good life”) and the
quality of society. Project leader is Prof. Dr. Philip Brey. The project
is part of a new international Centre of Excellence in Ethics and
Technology (http://www.ethicsandtechnology.eu) of the departments of
philosophy of Twente University, Delft University of Technology and
Eindhoven University of Technology.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
The aim of the PhD project is to perform a study of interpretations and
evaluations of new media and their consequences that are made by
representatives of major ideologies or worldviews, with the aim of
assessing how they relate to conceptions of the good life and the good
society held by these ideologies.  It will involve a study of liberal,
communitarian, conservative, religious and post materialist evaluations
of new media, and the assessment of what the benefits and harms of new
media cultures are and how these can be evaluated within these
ideologies.  It will also provide normative critiques of current
ideological stances regarding new media.
</p>
<p>

<h3>Profile</h3>
A Master’s degree or equivalent degree in philosophy, preferably with a
background in ethics and/or social or political philosophy.
</p>
<p>

Consideration will also be given to candidates with a multidisciplinary
Master’s degree on a topic relevant to the project and some background
in philosophy, and to exceptional (international) candidates with only a
bachelor’s degree in philosophy.
</p>
<p>

Demonstrable interest in philosophical issues relating to information
technology and new media (but previous work in this area not required).
Good analytical skills. Good communication skills in English, in writing
as well as orally. Good team spirit.  Creativity, open-mindedness, and
an ability to develop new ideas.
</p>
<p>

<h3>Offer</h3>
A four-year full-time Ph.D. position, preferably starting April 1, 2008.
The gross salary is € 2.000,- in the first year going up to € 2.558,- in
the fourth year (€ 27.456,- and € 35.699,- per annum, respectively,
including vacation pay and end-of-year bonus). The position also comes
