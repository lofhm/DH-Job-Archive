## Description



<p>The  KRDB research  centre  at the  Free  University of  Bozen-Bolzano
(http://www.inf.unibz.it/krdb/)  seeks  applicant  for a  postdoctoral
position. The bulk of the research to be carried out is in the context
of   the  ONTORULE   project  (http://ontorule-project.eu/),   and  is
concerned with the application of Description Logics to business rules
and  the   combination  of  production  rule   and  Description  Logic
formalisms.   Both   representational   adequacy   and   computational
complexity play important roles in such combinations.</p>

<p>Candidates must have  a strong research record and  a solid background
in description and/or modal  logics. Experience with first-order modal
and fixed-point logics, and to  a lesser extent experience with active
rule languages such as  production rules, is considered desirable, but
by no means mandatory.<a?
