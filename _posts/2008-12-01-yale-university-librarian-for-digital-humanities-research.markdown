General Purpose 
Digital humanities is an evolving specialization in librarianship that requires a combination of technical skill and strong background in the humanities, knowledge about how technology is transforming research, and energy for collaborating with students, faculty, and staff. We are looking for a creative, technically-grounded, visionary person to serve as an advisor, advocate, and implementer for digital humanities resources at Yale University Library. Reporting to the Head of Research Services and Collections (RSC), the Librarian for Digital Humanities Research will work closely with subject specialists, the department coordinator for research education, the Library Web Manager and other members of the Library’s technology department, and affiliates of the Collaborative Learning Center in order to provide the vision and strategic leadership for incorporating current and future technologies into the research activities of the humanities community at Yale University. The successful candidate will also participate in the development of the collection in an area related to his or her academic background.

Responsibilities 
The Librarian for Digital Humanities Research will employ information and Internet technologies to help Yale-affiliated researchers in the humanities make use of the rich collections available at the Yale University Library. The Librarian for Digital Humanities Research will offer consultation for faculty members’ research, and will research Web technologies (such as Zotero, RSS, mashups, tagging, and social networking sites) and promote them, as appropriate, to Yale faculty and students and library staff. Develops and tracks personal and departmental technology goals in collaboration with the head of RSC, the Library Web Manager and the head of Web, Workstation & Digital Consulting Services. In addition, the Librarian for Digital Humanities will collaborate with the Library Web Manager and other units to develop databases and portals for disseminating Library resources in support of humanities research, and to design and implement an integrated next-generation technological presence for the Library in general; ensure that RSC web pages conform to guidelines and usability standards established by the library technology group; and provide a high level of office technology support to the department. The successful candidate will coordinate RSC’s participation in the implementation of a Library-wide web content management system. The Librarian for Digital Humanities Research will be professionally active and serve on select Library-wide committees, engage in research and service to meet the library requirements for promotion, and will assume collection development responsibilities appropriate to the successful candidate’s academic background. May be required to assist with disaster recovery situations.

Appointment at the Librarian II level requires a minimum of two years of professional experience and demonstrated professional accomplishment. Appointment at the Librarian III level requires a minimum of 5 years of professional experience and professional accomplishment.

Demonstrably advanced skills in some combination of website management, text mark-up, graphics editing and database creation. Preferred: Candidate will possess, most importantly, a deep understanding of the research process and knowledge of the ways that new technologies are affecting the production of scholarship in the humanities, as distinct from other fields.  Preference will be given to candidates who demonstrate an exceptionally strong background in humanities, curiosity about how technology is affecting research, and enthusiasm for collaboration in an exciting and dynamic intellectual environment. Ideally the applicant will additionally have demonstrated knowledge in both front- and back-end technologies such as Web design and site management (including XHTML, CSS, graphics editing software), humanities technologies and standards (such as XML, EAD, and TEI), relational databases design and development, and server-side web-development (e.g., PERL, PHP, java, javascript, ASP or .Net).
