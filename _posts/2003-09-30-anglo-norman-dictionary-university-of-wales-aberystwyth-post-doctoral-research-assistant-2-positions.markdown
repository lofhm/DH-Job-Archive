## Description


<p>Following a further successful bid for funding, The Anglo-Norman Dictionary is offering two four-year full-time posts of Post-Doctoral Research Assistant, to work on the revision of letters F to H. Whereas the revision of  letters A-E relied on the conversion of entries created in MS-Word format to TEI-XML, this next phase will employ XML, based on P4 chapter 12, at all stages of the workflow.</p>

<p>In addition, there is a PhD scholarship open to a suitable graduate who wishes to undertake doctoral research on the lexis of shipping in Anglo-Norman, while learning the techniques of computerized lexicography using TEI markup.</p>
