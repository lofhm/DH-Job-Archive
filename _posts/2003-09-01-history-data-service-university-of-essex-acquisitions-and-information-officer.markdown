## Description



<p>The History Data Service collects, preserves, and promotes the use of digital resources, which result from or support historical research, learning and teaching. It is located within the Data Archive (<a href="http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/">http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/</a>) at the University of Essex and the Arts and Humanities Data Service (<a href="http://ahds.ac.uk">http://ahds.ac.uk</a>). </p>

<p>We are seeking to recruit an Acquisitions and Information Officer to develop and implement its acquisitions policy, and to coordinate and carry out the development of information about History Data Service, primarily, but not exclusively for publicity and information purposes. Duties will include the development of a targeted acquisitions policy, within the AHDS strategic plan, and in conjunction with the Head of Service, and the subsequent implementation of this policy. This will mean identifying priority acquisitions for History Data Service, contacting potential depositors, and liaising with them throughout the acquisitions process, until the resource becomes part of the collection.</p>

<p>The Acquisitions and Information Officer will also be responsible for developing publicity and information materials for the History Data Service within the AHDS common framework, which may also include the preparation of texts for publication online. Although primarily responsible in these areas the postholder will be expected to be flexible and to engage in other areas of the service's work as required.</p>

<p>Applicants should have a strong background in history, preferably at degree level, with an aptitude for researching and compiling information and excellent communication skills. A postgraduate degree in an appropriate subject e.g. history or related disciplines, or library and information studies would be an advantage as would some knowledge of the use of computers in historical research. Training will be provided where necessary. </p>

<p>Applicants are strongly advised to consult the History Data Service website (<a href="http://hds.essex.ac.uk">http://hds.essex.ac.uk</a>) and the Arts and Humanities Data Service website (<a href="http://ahds.ac.uk">http://ahds.ac.uk</a>) for further information. </p>

<p>Appointment to this post will be until July 2005 with the expectation of an extension, and will be on the grade 2 scale for Other Related Staff, £21,125 - £27,339 per annum.</p>
