## Background
The aim of Tate is to increase public awareness, understanding and enjoyment of British art from the 16th century to the present day, and of international modern and contemporary art.

The vision for 'Transforming Tate Britain: Building, Archives, Access' is to provide a model for transforming the way that people can access, engage with and learn about Britain's cultural heritage by using archival sources. We will do this through large scale digitisation of Tate's rich archive collections and associated learning and outreach programmes. In tandem we will transform the original 19th century building to meet the needs and expectations of 21st century audiences.

We will digitise 52,000 items from 52 archive collections, selected to give a broad picture of art and artists in Britain during the 20th century. We will create the technical infrastructure to integrate this archive material with 65,280 digitised artworks from Tate's collection already available online. The project is designed to ensure that audiences have the tools to enjoy and contribute to this heritage and engage in dialogue with Tate and each other about it.
