## Description





<p>The School of Computing at Dublin City University has an opening for a PhD research position. The position is available from 1 April 2008. The position is available for up to 4 years.</p>

<p>Research in the research group http://www.computing.dcu.ie/~cpahl) focuses on a range of techniques for software and information systems engineering. The working group comprises six researchers and offers a dynamic multi-cultural research atmosphere with high international visibility.
</p>

<p>The project is "Generation of Metadata and Subject Models: Subject Models and Lightweight Domain Models". The objective is to research and develop tools to support automatic and semi-automatic generation of lightweight subject ontologies. Information extraction techniques from semi-structured text sources e.g. document collections (corporate), website material, hypermedia encyclopaedia shall be used. The approach is to use knowledge to find knowledge (ontological and category knowledge). The project aims to develop a set of tools to provide informed generation or extension of subject models and ontologies.
This project is part of the Science Foundation Ireland SFI funded CSET Next Generation Localisation, in which digital content management is a research area that is addressed in close collaboration between Dublin City University, Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin.</p>

<p>Candidates are expected to have an interest in pursuing research in foundations and techniques for information architectures. A stipend of â‚¬ 16,000 per year for initially three years (tax free) plus a generous travel allowance is available for the position.</p>

<p>PhD candidates need to possess a University degree (normally, a four-year Bachelor or a Master degree) in Computer Science or a closely related discipline. Ideally, candidates have a strong background in the foundations of domain modelling and ontologies as well as techniques and methods of information extraction and model generation. Fluency in English (spoken and written) is required.</p>

<p>Dublin, the capital of Ireland, is a vibrant city located at Ireland's east coast. Dublin is Ireland's economic, cultural and academic centre. Dublin and Ireland are tourist hot spots that offer a wide range of recreational activities. Dublin's airport is well connected to Great Britain, mainland Europe and North America.</p>

<p>Please send your application (electronically as PDF or as plain ASCII text), including a CV, a list of publications (if applicable), copies of certificates and transcripts, and the names of at least two academic references to Dr. Claus Pahl, email: Claus.Pahl-at-dcu.ie.
