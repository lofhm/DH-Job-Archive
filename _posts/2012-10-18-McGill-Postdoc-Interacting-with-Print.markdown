The Interacting with Print Research Group at McGill University and the University of Montreal is seeking a postdoctoral fellow with interests in developing digital humanities methodologies for studying the print culture of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Europe. Candidates may specialize in history, art history, literature or a related discipline, and should have their doctorate in hand by the start date. The ideal candidate has experience in both information design and computer programming; expertise in data visualization, text mining, and designing digital tools is especially desirable. A working knowledge of French is an asset.

Interacting with Print researches how print media interact with other media within a larger communicative ecology. One of our primary concerns is how digital interfaces will reorient an extant print-cultural heritage. The postdoctoral fellow will be an integral member of the team, developing his or her own research and working with team members to develop their projects.

Review of applications will begin on **19 November 2012** and continue until the position is filled.
