digitally-enhanced teaching and research in the liberal arts. We 
welcome applicants who will extend and enhance this profile; assist 
in the establishment of a doctoral programme in Humanities Computing; 
initiate, develop, and lead substantial research projects at the

and dissemination of research work on the application of leading-edge 
approaches to humanities computing disciplines, such as knowledge 
representation, visual communication design, new media, hypertext,

statistical models, and broad library and research-based work that 
focuses on significant issues of textuality, interfaces, and 
information browsing and retrieval. Candidates should have 
significant experience in curriculum development in communication and 
digital media programmes at the graduate and/or undergraduate level. 
We would specifically welcome applicants who have led the successful 
development of new degree programmes. Candidates will have a 
substantial track record of success in obtaining funding from 
national and international agencies in infrastructure and research 
development. Candidates will have significant successful experience 
teaching at the undergraduate and graduate level and will be expected 
to continue to do so in this position.</p>
