information current, and enabling the online ACIS elections every other

<li>Familiarity with MySQL and the SQL Query language</li>
<li>Familiarity with HTML</li>
<li>Familiarity working with ISPs and Domain Registration agencies.</li>
</ul>

<p>The position of ACIS webmaster carries an annual stipend of $1500. For
