## Description



<p>
Postdoc Fellowship in Digital  History. The Department of History at the University of Chicago seeks applications and nominations for a two-year residential Mellon Postdoctoral Fellowship in digital history, beginning fall 2008 . The successful candidate will be expected to research how the proliferation of digital possibilities is changing the culture of historical inquiry and pedagogy. Areas of interest may include, for example, the provision of databases and search techniques (as in Google-type scanning projects), the use of digital media to convey aspects of cultural knowledge beyond the capability of the printed page, or the implications of global networking for the circulation and credibility of  historiographical claims among new audiences.  But the specific theme is open, and these are only three among a very wide range of possibilities.  The appointment will be at the rank of instructor. The fellow will combine research, writing, and half-time teaching, with the opportunity to teach two one-quarter courses per year (one undergraduate and one graduate) about the possibilities and implications of new media for historical knowledge. Open to applicants who will have received the PhD within five academic years previous to the year of the award; persons holding tenure-track appointments are ineligible to apply. Applications include a c.v., a chapter length piece of writing and three letters of recommendation. Applications will be read as soon as they arrive. No electronic applications will be accepted. Please address all materials to: Mellon Postdoctoral Fellowship Search Committee, Dept of History, University of Chicago, 1126 East 59th Street, Chicago, IL 60637-1580. The University of Chicago is an AA/EOE
