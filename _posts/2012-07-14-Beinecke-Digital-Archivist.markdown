####The University and the Library  
The Yale University Library, as one of the world's leading research libraries, collects, organizes, preserves, and provides access to and services for a rich and unique record of human thought and creativity. It fosters intellectual growth and supports the teaching and research missions of Yale University and scholarly communities worldwide. A distinctive strength is its rich spectrum of resources, including around 12.8 million volumes and information in all media, ranging from ancient papyri to early printed books to electronic databases. The Library is engaging in numerous projects to expand access to its physical and digital collections. Housed in eighteen buildings including the Sterling Memorial Library, the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, and the Bass Library, it employs a dynamic and diverse staff of approximately five hundred who offer innovative and flexible services to library readers.

####Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library  
The Beinecke Library, one of the world's largest libraries devoted entirely to rare books and manuscripts, is Yale's principal repository for literary archives, early manuscripts, and rare books. The Beinecke collections are internationally known and heavily used by scholars from around the world. In addition to distinguished general collections, the Beinecke Library houses the Osborn Collection, noted for its British and literary and historical manuscripts, and outstanding special collections devoted to American literature, German literature, and Western Americana.  The Beinecke’s collections include materials ranging from papyrus and medieval manuscripts to born-digital files.  For further information about the Beinecke Library, consult the library's web site at: <http://www.library.yale.edu/beinecke>.
 
The Beinecke Library has been acquiring born-digital manuscript material for more than a decade, and the Beinecke’s Manuscript Unit has been increasingly active over the past several years in developing local infrastructure, services, standards, and best practices, most recently (2009-2011) as part of the multi-institutional AIMS project (Born Digital Collections: An Inter-Institutional Model for Stewardship).  The Beinecke Library is poised to expand its capacity to collect born-digital materials, make them available for research, and responsibly preserve them for future scholarship.

Reporting to the Head of the Manuscript Unit, with a dotted line to the Head of Technology and Digital Assets, this position closely supports staff throughout the Beinecke in their work to collect, manage, and make available digital materials.
