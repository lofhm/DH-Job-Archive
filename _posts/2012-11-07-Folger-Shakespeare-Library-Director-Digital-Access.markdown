The Folger Shakespeare Library invites nominations and applications for the position of Director of Digital Access. Founded in 1932, the Folger is home to the world’s largest collection of Shakespeare-related materials and the finest collection of early Continental and British printed works outside England. It offers an expansive range of scholarly, cultural, and educational outreach programs that inform, enrich, and entertain more than 100,000 individuals each year. With an endowment significantly above $200 million, the Library is administered by a Board of Governors under the auspices of Amherst College, founder Henry Clay Folger’s alma mater.
 
The Director of the Library seeks a dynamic individual to serve in the newly-created position of Director of Digital Access. This leadership position will work with other senior staff to expand the library’s existing digital outreach, create meaningful access to Folger expertise, and develop an infrastructure that will establish the Folger’s reputation as a center for the digital humanities.
 
The successful applicant will have an advanced degree and a record of accomplishment in online humanities scholarship and outreach. He/she must have experience in management and supervision, familiarity with application development and other emerging technologies, and a strong grasp of trends in humanities scholarship. He/she should also demonstrate a significant record of success in grant writing, community building, and an ability to collaborate with people from a variety of disciplines.
 
The Director of Digital Access will serve as a member of the Director’s senior leadership team and, in coordination with the Director, will be responsible for developing a strategy for the current and future library’s digital initiatives, which encompass all aspects of its operations.  He/she works closely with the Director and other members of the leadership team to determine how digital assets at the Folger should be deployed to expand access for both scholarly and popular audiences.
 
The successful candidate will be a strategic thinker, with excellent analytical, written, and oral communication and organizational proficiency. He/she will demonstrate a thorough understanding of the Folger’s unique role in the cultural and scholarly communities, and be responsive to the needs of the various components of the institution and its mission.
