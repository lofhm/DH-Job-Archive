The Department of History at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte invites applications for a director of the Public History concentration within the M.A. program in History to begin August 2013.  We intend to appoint a tenure-track faculty member at the Assistant/Associate Professor level.  Applicants are required to have a Ph.D. in history or related field.  Required qualifications include a record of research, publication and teaching experience appropriate to rank, expertise in digital history, and public history work experience. Research and teaching specialty is open. Because the College and department strive to develop a deep understanding of and respect for diversity among students and colleagues, we encourage applications from those who can help us achieve this goal.

The successful candidate will have an opportunity to redesign the Public History program to include a digital history focus since this is one of four positions being recruited by the College this year requiring expertise in the digital humanities.  Within a 2-1 teaching load, the successful candidate will teach core courses in the program in public history as well as undergraduate courses in their specialty.  Additional responsibilities include recruitment, identifying internships, advising students, collaborating with community organizations and, as far as feasible, pursuing external sources of funding.

The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences houses 20 departments in the humanities, social and behavioral sciences, physical sciences, and military sciences, as well as eight research centers and institutes and 13 interdisciplinary programs.
