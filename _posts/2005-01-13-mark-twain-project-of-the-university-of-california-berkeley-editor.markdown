Job Description: <a href="http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/MTP/">The Mark Twain Project</a>, housed in the world's largest collection of materials by and about Mark Twain, is a scholarly edition committed to publishing all of the author's significant writings. Relying both on the research and editorial expertise of its staff and the enormous resources available in the archive (much of which was bequeathed to the University by Mark Twain's daughter), MTP has produced award-winning critical editions of Mark Twain's works and his private papers. It has now been funded by the <a href="http://www.neh.fed.us/">National Endowment for the Humanities</a> to create an electronic edition of Mark Twain's complete letters. This NEH grant project entails encoding the texts of thousands of letters as well as additional critical material in XML for eventual display and use via the World Wide Web.<br><br>

Responsibilities: Encode Mark Twain's letters in XML using a modified version of the Text Encoding Initiative DTD. Review encoded material for stylistic consistency and adherence to guidelines. Under supervision, contribute to the editing of Mark Twain's texts, following established editorial principles and performing proofreading, fact checking, and historical research as necessary. Assist in the overall maintenance and development of encoding guidelines by participating in discussions about unresolved issues and updating the guidelines as directed. Perform routine checking and debugging of encoded files. Assist in general archival management, including maintenance, organization, and updating of the Mark Twain Papers collection as needed.<br><br>

Requirements & Qualifications: Knowledge of humanities computing, scholarly textual editing, and, in particular, the procedures, guidelines, and policies of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) or a similar XML-based humanities encoding project. Proficiency in XML (including DTDs). Excellent proofreading and copyediting skills.<br><br>

Demonstrated ability to communicate effectively orally and in writing. Demonstrated ability to understand and apply editorial theory and judgment. Ability to be extremely detail-oriented and have an eye for error. Ability to manage time effectively, work efficiently, work independently and with a team, recognize and solve problems (or know when to refer them), and meet deadlines.<br><br>

Preferred: Intermediate relational database skills. Knowledge of WordPerfect, XSL, CSS, HTML, Perl and regular expressions. Advanced degree in English, humanities computing, information science, or an allied field. Experience in digital publishing, textual encoding, or scholarly editing.<br><br>

Other: This is a temporary career position with an end date of 10/06 and the possibility of extension beyond that date.
