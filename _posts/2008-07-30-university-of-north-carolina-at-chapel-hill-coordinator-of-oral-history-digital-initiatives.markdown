## Description


<h3>Coordinator of Oral History Digital Initiatives</h3>
<h3>Southern Oral History Program</h3>
<h3>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</h3>

<p>The Southern Oral History Program (SOHP) in the Center for the Study
of the American South seeks a Coordinator of Oral History Digital
Initiatives to oversee the SOHP's participation in a three-year,
cross-university collaboration focused on "the long civil rights
movement," stretching back to the 1940s and continuing with the
extension of struggles for social justice into new arenas after the
1960s. Competitive applicants must demonstrate expertise in oral
history research and the use of digital technologies in the
humanities. Reporting to the SOHP's Director and working alongside
the Associate Director, the Coordinator will help to plan, supervise,
and evaluate student fieldwork conducted throughout the project. The
Coordinator will assume primary responsibility for the creative use
of digital technologies and of new forms of collaborative research,
interpretation, and ultimately publication. Tasks will include
managing relationships with on-site and virtual scholarly
collaborators and the selection, scholarly annotation, and
contextualization of oral history materials for use in digital
archives and other publishing experiments. In addition, the
Coordinator will help to plan and implement a conference on the long
civil rights movement in the spring of 2009. The ideal candidate will
have both academic and administrative experience and must be able to
work independently on long-term projects, while at the same time
performing an array of short-term tasks in a collaborative setting.
The position requires excellent oral and written, interpersonal, and
organizational skills; familiarity with new media; and the ability to
build cross- and off-campus partnerships. PhD in U.S. history
preferred. Will also consider candidates with two years of relevant
experience and an MLS or an MA in history or a related field.

Salary Range $50,000-$55,000.
To begin fall 2008.
