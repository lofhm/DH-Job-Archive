## Description


<p>The Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (LIA) of the Swiss Federal Institute of  Technology at Lausanne (EPFL)  carries out research projects   in  several   domains  of   Language   Processing  and Man-Machine  Dialogue (probabilistic  parsing,  content sensitive document management,  information retrieval, text  mining) and is involved   in   several    European   projects   and   industrial collaborations. (URL: <a href="http://liawww.epfl.ch/Research/research.html#NaturalLanguageProcessing"> http://liawww.epfl.ch/Research/research.html#NaturalLanguageProcessing</a>)</p>

<p>The  LIA  is  currently  looking  for  a  Post-Doctoral  Research Assistant in  Computer Science to contribute to  its research and development  activities in  the domain  of  Man-Machine Dialogue. The foreseen  research activity will take place  in the framework of the  European Project INSPIRE (briefly described bellow), for which the selected candidate would be partly responsible.</p>

<p>Applicants should hold a  PhD in Computer Science (or equivalent) or expect to complete one  before the start date.  Good knowledge of  C/C++ is  required.  Background in  Man-Machine Dialogue  and Natural Language Processing is desirable.</p>

<p>The position is  available immediately and runs for  1 year (with possible  continuation).   It will  be  held  at EPFL  (Lausanne, Switzerland).</p>

<p>The  appointment  will be  in  the order  of  70'000  CHF a  year (~ $42'000,  ~ 48'000 euros)  depending on the  qualification and experience of the applicant.</p>

<p>Interested persons should submit a resume to (e-mail preferred):</p>

<p>Description of the work for EPFL in the INSPIRE Project</p>

<p>INSPIRE European Project (IST-2001 research Programme)</p>

<p>Title:  INfotainment management with SPeech Interaction via Remote-microphones and tElephone interfaces</p>

<p>Full Project Abstract:</p>
<p>The proposed  project aims at  the development of  a multilingual interactive, natural speech dialogue-based assistant for wireless command  and control  of home  appliances. Emphasis  is  given on infotainment   equipment  and   services,  due   to   their  high complexity,    which   makes    advanced    dialogue   techniques necessary.  To this end,  leading-edge technologies  available to the   partners  of   the  consortium,   i.e.   continuous  speech recognition, speech synthesis, speaker identification, etc., will be integrated into a  prototype, which will be extensively tested and optimized.  The user of the  proposed system will  be able to initiate natural  spoken dialogues and ask  for information about the current status of any appliance and/or control it, requesting assistance on its use, etc.  Furthermore, he/she will be able, to use   the  connection   with  the   public  network,   to  access telecommunication voice services etc.</p>

<p>EPFL is involved in the "Dialogue Interaction" Work Package (WP): In this WP,  the dialogue component will be  set up. Multilingual Wizard of Oz (WoZ) experiments will be conducted to determine the dialogue flow for each language  that will be incorporated in the system.  A  dialogue  simulation   tool  will  be  developed  and additional user modelling functionalities will be incorporated to the dialogue component. The  dialogue and language models derived from the WoZ experiments will be used as bootstrap models for the dialogue  system.   Subsequently,  when  the system  is  set  up, utterances spoken  by users will  be recorded and  transcribed in order to improve the current dialogue and language models.</p>
