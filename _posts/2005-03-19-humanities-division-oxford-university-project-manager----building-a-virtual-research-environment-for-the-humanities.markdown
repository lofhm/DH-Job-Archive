<p>ACADEMIC-RELATED RESEARCH STAFF GRADE IA: Salary Â£23,643 p.a. on the RSIA scale</p>

<p>Opportunities to develop Oxford's Virtual Research Environment.</p> <p>Oxford University has been awarded significant funding from the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) to develop infrastructure and tools for the next generation of collaborative research environments. We are seeking enthusiastic individuals with excellent technical development and project management skills to contribute to three Virtual Research Environment (VRE) projects over the next two years:</p> <ul><li>Building a Virtual Research Environment for the Humanities (BVREH) - determining the most effective ways to support national and international humanities research.</li><li>VRE for the Integrative Biology Research Consortium (IB VRE) - supporting the entire research process of a large-scale international research consortium.</li> <li>Sakai VRE Portal Demonstrator (Sakai VRE) - extending an open source, standards-based portal framework (led by Lancaster University with Oxford University as a key partner).</li></ul> <p>Further information about the projects and other opportunities available can be found via <a href="http://www.vre.ox.ac.uk/">http://www.vre.ox.ac.uk/</a>.</p> <p>The Humanities Division is one of the five academic divisions of the University of Oxford. Its subject areas include English, History, Classics, Philosophy, Modern Languages, Theology, Music and Fine Art. Humanities researchers at Oxford have been amongst the leaders in innovative use of ICT. The resources at Oxford provide an ideal testbed for a project to define and develop the potential benefits of a VRE for the national and international Humanities research community. An introduction to the Humanities Division can be found at <a href="http://www.humanities.ox.ac.uk/">http://www.humanities.ox.ac.uk/</a>.</p> <p>You will be responsible for project management throughout the duration of the programme and the detailed conduct of the user survey that forms its initial stage. You will have broad experience in the Humanities Computing sector, an understanding of the techniques and technologies used, strong analytical skills, and the ability to write reports with clarity and to meet deadlines. You will be effective at communicating with a wide range of people with whom you will interact in the course of the project. Previous experience of conducting ICT user surveys will be a strong advantage. This post will be based in the Humanities Division, but will work closely with other members of the Oxford VRE community.</p> <p>Further particulars including details of how to apply can be obtained from Ms K. Brill, Classics Centre, George Street, Oxford OX1 2RL (tel: 01865-288385, email: karen.brill@classics.ox.ac.uk).</p> <p>The closing date is 18 March 2005. Interviews will be held in the second half of April 2005. Please indicate clearly if you would like to be considered for any of the other VRE posts in addition to your preferred post (on the understanding that your application may be shared across selection panels and you may be asked to submit further information or attend a second interview).
