This position expands a thriving public history program in which students receive a Master's degree in History with a concentration in Museum Studies. The program has partnerships with a number of local cultural institutions, including the International Civil Rights Center and Museum, Greensboro Historical Museum, Guilford Courthouse National Military Park, and High Point Museum.

UNCG is a high-research activity university with a professionally active history department of 20 tenured and tenure-track faculty working in a wide range of geographical and topical areas. The graduate program includes a Ph.D. in American history. The University encourages and rewards community-engaged research and teaching. 

Greensboro is a diverse city, reflective of the larger adjacent diverse metropolitan area. UNCG is also the most diverse campus in the UNC system, reflected in the composition of its undergraduate student body.

The program seeks applicants with the expertise and passion to build bridges between universities and communities; to inspire and train graduate students; and to join with existing faculty in program administration and long-term planning.
