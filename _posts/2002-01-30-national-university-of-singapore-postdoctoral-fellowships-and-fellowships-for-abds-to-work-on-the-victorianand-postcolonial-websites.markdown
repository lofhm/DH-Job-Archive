## Description


<p>The Web Initiative at the University Scholars Programme, National University of Singapore, headed by George Landow, who holds a dual appointment at Brown and NUS, is looking for researchers in the humanities to work in Singapore on sites that receive as many as 8.3 million hits/month and which are recommended by the ministries of education in France, Sweden, Ireland, Scotland, NEH, BBC, etc. etc.</p>

<p>We pay a postdoc about US $30,000, which is the equivalent in the USA of maybe $45,000, since (a) living expenses are lower, (b) income taxes are about 15%, (c) the first $75,000/year are US tax free. The term can be anywhere from 6-12 months, and we'd be able to fly someone to the UK or US for a week or two's research.  Here is the description:</p>

<p>a. We need two postdoctoral fellows for the Victorian Web and  one for the Postcolonial Webs. Their tasks will be some  -- not all -- of the following:</p>
<p>I. Linking materials across disciplines, including creating crossroads or transition documents;</p>

<p>II. Develop new materials by researching, writing, and then integrating them;</p>

<p>III. Assist win the proof-reading of links and images as well as the addition of new links;</p>

<p>IV. Help conceptualise, create, and manage links among both individual disciplines within a web (e.g. science, literature, and economics) and between major webs (e.g., materials within individual disciplines, say, history  in both Singapore and Victorian Webs.)</p>

<p>V. Recruit contributors who will both write new materials and grant permission to include major out-of-print materials on which they hold copyright;</p>

<p>VI. Carry out major projects such as the integration of complete books into the Victorian Web;</p>

<p>VII. Experiment with and formulate rules for sharing relatively advanced scholarly and scientific research topics with materials  used by learners at more basic stages, the subsidiary goal of the project being to provide materials, including introductions and study questions, for secondary school and beginning university students.</p>

<p>VIII. Create a directory of syllabi world for modules and courses on selected subjects from major universities throughout the, thus making the sites an international "place-to-go" for model syllabi.</p>

<p>Those interested, who can base their work in any humanities field, including history of science and technology, should examine the websites before applying; they can be found at</p>

<p>www.victorianweb.org     and www.postcolonialweb.org</p>

<p>or http://www.scholars.nus.edu.sg/landow/victorian/   and</p>

<p>Applicants should contact uspdean@nus.edu.sg. We plan to interview literature candidates at this year's MLA meeting in New Orleans, and other arrangements can be made.</p>
