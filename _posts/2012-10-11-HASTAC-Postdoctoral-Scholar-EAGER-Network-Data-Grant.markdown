## Description

HASTAC is currently seeking a Postdoctoral Scholar to carry out social network data analysis  for a newly awarded $294,000 NSF EAGER project "Assessing the Impact of Technology-Aided Participation and Mentoring on Transformative Interdisciplinary Research:  A Data-Based Study of the Incentives and Success of an Exemplar Academic Network.”  Through a large-scale analysis of  the HASTAC social network, the Postdoc will investigate the interplay of cyberinfrastructure and scholarly communication, combining cutting-edge data mining methods with thoughtful human and institutional questions to examine how virtual interdisciplinary connections and mentoring can promote new modes of research, learning, teaching, and career development. Computational analysis, data extraction, and social networking analysis will be used to examine six years’ worth of data from the HASTAC website, which is built on the Drupal platform.  The full call, as well as the abstract and a link to the full proposal, is posted below. Interested parties should submit their materials by **Friday, November 16, 2012.**

### OPEN POSTDOCTORAL POSITION

NSF OCI-1243622  
Early-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER), Division of Cyberinfrastructure, National Science Foundation

**Title:**   “Assessing the Impact of Technology-Aided Participation and Mentoring on Transformative Interdisciplinary Research:  A Data-Based Study of the Incentives and Success of an Exemplar Academic Network”

**Skills:**  Demonstrated experience with mathematical and visual social network analysis, quantitative and qualitative methods (including case study and ethnographic) for mapping collaborative networks, citation networks, professional networks, mentoring relationships, structural cohesion and integration within and across disciplines and institutions. Candidate must be able to participate in and generate dialogue with faculty and students about these issues and then test hypotheses using HASTAC’s data or gathering new data (survey, interviews, case study, ethnography).  

**Organizational assignment:**  The postdoctoral fellow will work in the PhD Lab in Digital Knowledge at Duke University or possibly in the Information Futures Project Space (under construction) and will be part of a multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary Technology-Aided Participation Advisory Board.   The fellow will be expected to maintain a virtual presence on the HASTAC site, reporting on preliminary findings, posting white papers for peer-to-peer feedback from the HASTAC community, and working within HASTAC’s network structure to generate new ideas, problems, and questions to be addressed.  

**Position availability:**   Start date December 2012, or earliest availability; residency at Duke University highly desirable.  In an exceptional case, fellow may reside virtually, with a telepresence accessible during business hours and a monthly residence (week long) for site-specific meetings, collaborations, and events.

**Outcomes:**  In addition to working with the HASTAC team to produce a number of local and webcast events (seminars, webinars, conferences), the postdoctoral fellow will be expected to maintain a virtual presence on the www.hastac.org site, reporting on preliminary findings, posting white papers for peer-to-peer feedback from the HASTAC community, and working within HASTAC’s network structure to generate new ideas, problems, and questions to be addressed.  The fellow will also be expected to present papers at scholarly conferences and to submit final work to refereed journals in social science, science studies, and other relevant fields.  

**Type of contract:** 6 month to 1 year (with renewable second year possible based on performance)

**Salary:**  $48,000-55,000 annually, prorated for months worked and commensurate with experience

**Application deadline:  5pm EST, Friday, November 16, 2012**
