The Modernist Versions Project (MVP) seeks applicants for a post-doctoral fellowship valued at $31,500/year for two years. The successful applicant will be expected to join the project on site in Victoria, BC and to take a leading role in developing the next phase of the MVP as well as pursuing his or her own original research. He or she will have some background in TEI, as well as data visualization and/or interface design. Naturally, the successful applicant must also have a strong background in literary modernism, preferably in modernist fiction. Experience with textual editing is an asset.

The MVP has over $2 million in support from its Partners: the Modernist Journals Project (MJP), Networked Infrastructure for Nineteenth-century Electronic Scholarship (NINES), Editing Modernism in Canada (EMiC), The Modernism Lab, and Islandora/DiscoveryGarden. It is co-directed by Stephen Ross (University of Victoria), J. Matthew Huculak (Dalhousie University), Tanya Clement (University of Texas at Austin), Susan Schreibman (Trinity College Dublin), Jentery Sayers (University of Victoria), and James Gifford (Fairleigh Dickinson University). In the fall of 2012, it will host at least three post-doctoral fellows, two doctoral students, and several MA researchers in addition to the members of the Board. More details on the MVP are available at [www.modernistversions.com](www.modernistversions.com).

For more information, or to inquire about applying, please contact the MVP Board via Stephen Ross at saross@uvic.ca.
