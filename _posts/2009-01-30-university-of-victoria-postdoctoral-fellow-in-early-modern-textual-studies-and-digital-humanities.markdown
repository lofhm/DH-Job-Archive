## Description



<p>The Electronic Textual Cultures Laboratory  (ETCL) [URL: <
http://etcl.uvic.ca/ >] at the University of Victoria has an exciting
two-year postdoctoral opportunity for a candidate with a background in
early modern literary and textual studies, expertise in computing, and
an interest in the digital humanities field.</p>
<p>The postdoctoral fellow will be key in the development of a professional
reading environment designed to respond to the needs of those working
with early modern books and manuscripts. Source material for this work
will be derived from our work on the /Devonshire Manuscript/ (BL Add MS
17,492) and our ongoing work with professional reading environments in
number of related projects.</p><p>The successful candidate will have skills and aptitudes in early modern
research, textual studies, and scholarly editing in a digital humanities
context, including training or demonstrated experience working with TEI
XML and digital editions. Organizational skills are essential. Interest
and aptitude in research planning and management would be an asset. The
ability to work in concert with our existing team is a critical requirement.</p>
<p>Examples of technologies employed in related ETCL projects are as
follows: TEI P5; XML, XSLT, XSL and XHTML encoding; XQuery; eXist XML
databases; JavaScript; Ruby on Rails; PHP; CSS; and web-based SQL
database projects using PostgresSQL and mySQL. Experience in some or all
of these areas would be an asset, but is not a requirement, though
aptitude with digital tools is required.</p>
<p>Our current team members pride themselves on a passionate interest in
both the humanities and their computation engagement. Our ideal
candidate is someone with similar passions who can introduce the team to
new ideas and provide new perspectives on existing digital humanities
issues.</p>
<p>Salary for this position is competitive in the Canadian context, and is
governed in part by SSHRC practices; combined with a local supplement,
the annual salary for this position is expected to be $52,000, inclusive
of benefits and travel allowances.</p>

<p>Applications, comprising a brief cover letter, CV, and the names and
contact information for three referees, may be sent electronically to
etcl.apply@gmail.com Applications will
be received and reviewed until the position is filled; the position can
begin as early as January 2009.</p>
