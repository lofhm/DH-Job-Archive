## Position Description

The University of Southampton seeks to appoint a post-doctoral Research Assistant to work on the AHRC-funded research project ‘City Witness: Place and Perspective in Medieval Swansea’. The project will investigate place and identity in medieval Swansea, bringing together work on medieval texts, GIS mapping and 3D visualisation. The project is a collaborative enterprise between teams in the Faculty of Humanities, University of Southampton (lead institution), the Department of Geography, Archaeology and Palaeoecology, Queen’s University Belfast and the Department of Digital Humanities, King’s College, London: an example of the project team’s previous work, on medieval Chester, can be viewed at http://www.medievalchester.ac.uk/.

The Research Assistant is required to produce a full critical edition (with translation) of the witness statements describing the hanging of the Welshman William ‘Cragh’ in Swansea in the late thirteenth century. The Research Assistant will also contribute more widely to the production of the online digital resource and project research, and will liaise with partners in Swansea including the Glamorgan Gwent Archaeological Trust and Swansea Council. The Research Assistant will be based in the English Department and Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Culture at Southampton.

The University of Southampton seeks to attract a researcher with excellent skills in Latin translation, palaeography and textual criticism, who holds a PhD (or is close to completion) in a relevant area (e.g. Medieval Latin, Medieval Studies). The researcher should be able to work as part of a collaborative research team and engage with interdisciplinary and theoretical perspectives. An interest in Digital Humanities is essential (though previous experience is not necessary), as is a commitment to public engagement.

The position is fixed term for a period of 18 months, from 01 January 2013. It is a part-time position at 0.5 FTE.

Informal enquiries are welcome and should be directed to the Project Director, Professor Catherine A. M. Clarke (c.a.clarke@soton.ac.uk). Interviews will be held in the week beginning Monday 19 November, 2012.
