# Mark Steinberg Weil Early Career Fellowship in Digital Humanities at Washington University in St. Louis

* [Original Link](http://hdw.artsci.wustl.edu/weilfellowship)

The Humanities Digital Workshop at Washington University in St. Louis invites applications for a three-year early-career fellowship in digital humanities, to begin July 1, 2012. We seek scholars with expertise in any of a broad range of humanities topics and methods -- quantitative history, network analysis, topic-modeling, statistical approaches to book history, lexicography, computer-assisted stylistics, text-processing, or human-computer interaction. The fellow’s research program should employ analysis of digitized texts or data to extend or contest current understandings of literary, political, social, or cultural history. Candidates must have completed their doctorates after 2008, and must have completed all requirements for the Ph.D. before July 1, 2012.

The Weil fellowship was established to foster the professional development of gifted scholars and the further enrichment of the university’s vigorous research environment. The HDW fellow is expected to pursue her or his own research, but will also join the research team of one or more of the projects currently supported by the HDW; the Fellow is expected to participate in the intellectual life of the HDW as well as of other units relevant to the Fellow’s research interests. Teaching responsibilities include a course each Fall and Spring semester, as well as supervision of a small number of students. Some courses may be centered in the Fellow’s substantive discipline; others may straddle disciplines, but with a methodological focus in digital scholarship. Fellows are expected to be in residence during the entire fellowship period, apart from research-related travel. Fellows will receive a salary of $60,000 per year, plus Washington University postdoctoral benefits; and a $5,000 annual research/travel stipend.

Applicants should submit a CV, graduate school transcript, two letters of recommendation, a description of the proposed research project, a brief account of the applicant’s involvement in digital humanities, and a proposal for a seminar (introductory or advanced) in digital humanities. Submit all application materials electronically to the HDW Fellowship Search Committee, c/o hdw-artsci@wustl.edu. Inquiries may be directed to Joseph Loewenstein jfloewen@wustl.edu or Douglas Knox dknox@wustl.edu. Washington University in St. Louis is an AA/EO employer, and strongly encourages applications from women, ethnic minorities, veterans, and individuals with disabilities.

**Applications must be received by March 1, 2012.**
