## Description









<h3>The Arnhold Postdoctoral Fellowship in Early Modern Literature and Media Technology</h3>

<p>The UC Santa Barbara English Department invites applications for the Arnhold Postdoctoral Scholar Fellowship. This fellowship has a term of one year, but may be renewable for a second year. The fellowship offers recent recipients of the Ph.D. (awarded between January 1, 2003, and June 30, 2006) a unique opportunity to develop their research and teaching interests within the UCSB Early Modern Center; the UCSB Transcriptions Center for literature and the culture of information; and the UC system-wide Transliteracies Project on the technological, social, and cultural practices of online reading.</p>

<p>The fellowship is designed to attract a scholar who is not currently in a tenure track position and who works in some area of British literature 1500-1800 and directly addresses the material, technological, social, or aesthetic dimensions of literature as media.  The Fellow's research, for instance, might be related to such current fields as "history of the book," "media archaeology", or the technology of literature.  We welcome candidates who have an interest in the relation between early media and contemporary digital new media supported by familiarity with some branch of digital media practice, as well as contributing to the diversity and excellence of the academic community through research, teaching and service.</p>

<p>The Fellow will participate in the research programs mentioned above; teach four courses, at least one of which would be a graduate research colloquium related to the fellow's research project. The position requires full-time residence at UCSB during fall, winter, and spring quarters of the academic year.  Compensation includes a salary of $45,000, plus an annual research fund of $3,000. The Fellow will have full access to the Early Modern Center and Transcriptions computing labs; access to the Department's web and database servers and technical support.</p>

<p>Applicants will be evaluated on the basis of their application materials. We will be interviewing for this fellowship at the MLA convention. Receipt of all applications will be acknowledged.  This UC position carries the title of "Postdoctoral Scholar". The University of California is an EO/AA employer.</p>
