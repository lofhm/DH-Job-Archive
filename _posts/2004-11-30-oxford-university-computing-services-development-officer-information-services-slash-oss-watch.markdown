## Description



<p>Grade: RS1<br />
Salary: £19,460 - £29,128</p>
<p>OUCS offers facilities, training and advice to members of the University in all aspects of academic computing. The OUCS Research Technologies Service brings together initiatives focussing on the support of research and utilizing leading-edge technologies, including the development and deployment of Open Source Software. Based within the RTS, OSS Watch provides unbiased advice and guidance about free and open source software to the UK's higher and further education communities. See <a href="http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/rts/">http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/rts/</a>.</p>

<p>We are looking for a Development Officer to strengthen and develop both the information services of OUCS, and the OSS Watch advisory service; it is divided evenly between the two activities.</p>

<p>You will assist OUCS in general, and OSS Watch in particular, with understanding, explaining, and deploying web-based information services, and open source software. These activities will be undertaken through a mixture of technical development and implementation; production of written materials; and presentations or meetings.</p>

<p>If you have an appropriate degree or extensive relevant experience, a working knowledge of tools for developing online  information systems (e.g. XML/XSLT, Java) and familiarity with open source software and ideas, then please get in touch  with us. The ability to communicate, both orally and in writing, to a range of audiences, is considered an essential  aspect of this post.</p>

<p>You should have a genuine interest in open source issues, be willing to learn about new technologies, and want to join a friendly multidisciplinary team.</p>

<p>This is an open-ended contract dependent on continued funding from JISC (the Joint Information Systems Committee).</p>

<p>Please obtain further details and an application form from The Personnel Office, Oxford University Computing Services, 13 Banbury Road, Oxford OX2 6NN, tel: 01865-283289, e mail: recruitment@oucs.ox.ac.uk. Alternatively download the forms directly from the main jobs page. You are strongly encouraged to submit a completed application form and covering letter which details how your qualifications and experience fulfill the specified criteria in the further particulars.</p>

<p>Completed applications must be received by noon on 12th November 2004. Interviews will be held on 26th November 2004.</p>
