## Description




<p>The Centre for Next Generation Localisation (CNGL) is a major 5-year 16.8 million Euro research centre funded by Science Foundation Ireland.
</p>
<p>
Hosted at Dublin City University, the CNGL will involve more than 100 researchers across a consortium of leading Irish Universities (DCU, TCD, UCD and UL) and 9 industrial partners. The CNGL will develop new technologies for localisation of digital content by adapting it to domain, culture and language.  For more details see: <http://www.computing.dcu.ie/news/newsitems/sem1_0708/josef/index.html>http://www.computing.dcu.ie/news/newsitems/sem1_0708/josef/index.html.
</p>
<p>
One of the major research strands within the CNGL is Digital Content Management (DCM) (other research activities include Machine Translation, Speech Processing, MT-Speech integration, Localisation and Systems Framework).
</p>
<p>
I am pleased to announce openings for 1 post-doctoral researcher and _four_ PhD student positions based at Dublin City University to conduct research in the area of information access for multilingual content.
</p>
<p>
The main areas that we intend to cover include:
<ul>
<li>adaptive techniques for cross-language querying (both text and speech)</li>
<li>improved content indexing for multilingual content</li>
<li>user modelling and query adaptation for improved multilingual search</li>
<li>evaluation of techniques for multilingual retrieval</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>

Positions are open to be filled immediately.
</p>
<p>

Post-doctoral research positions are typically for a period of 3 years and are funded to provide a salary from €40,000 - €45,000 depending on the candidate's background and experience.
</p>
<p>

PhD positions are typically for 4 years, and students will receive a stipend of about €16,000 in addition to payment of registration fees.
</p>
<p>

Staff will work in the well equipped laboratories of the CNGL and there is ample opportunity for travel.
</p>
<p>

Candidates for these positions will ideally have a strong background in computing, with a demonstrated interest in information retrieval and/or natural language processing.  In addition, we would expect that post-doctoral applicants would have a track record of relevant publications in the area.
</p>
<p>

To apply, please send by email: a CV, a short statement of why you are applying for this position and contact details of three references to Dr Gareth Jones, email: <mailto:Gareth.Jones@computing.dcu.ie>Gareth.Jones@computing.dcu.ie. In your application please indicate your preferred starting date if successful. Informal inquiries about the positions are very well welcome.
