The University of Houston invites applications for a post-doctoral fellowship in Digital Humanities beginning January 16, 2013. The position is available for one year and renewable for a second year at the discretion of the University. We welcome candidates who hold (or will hold by January 2013) a Ph.D. in any humanities discipline, but particularly encourage applications from candidates with expertise and research in digital humanities and/or computational methods. Any applicant should have received his or her Ph.D. no earlier than 2010.

The postdoctoral fellow will be in residence at the main campus of the University of Houston. The fellow will spend 65 percent of the time coordinating the activities of the interdisciplinary Digital Humanities Initiative, including scheduling speakers, organizing and participating in mini-workshops and reading groups, developing grant applications and other funding sources with faculty and graduate students, and other appropriate tasks as assigned. There are no teaching duties but the fellow will help develop DH courses and training programs. For more information on the Digital Humanities Initiative, see http://www.uh.edu/class/digitalhumanities/. The fellow will report directly to the Associate Dean for Faculty and Research in the College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences. The fellow may spend the other 35 percent of the time on the fellow’s own research.

Applicants should submit their applications electronically to cdue-hackney@uh.edu. Applications should be in a pdf file that includes a cover letter, a description of the applicant’s research program in digital humanities and/or computational methods (no more than 3 single-spaced pages), and a curriculum vitae. Additionally three letters of recommendation should be sent to the same e-mail address. The deadline is October 15, 2012. Review of applications will begin immediately and continue until the position is filled. Final candidates will be invited for interviews in person or via the Internet.

The University of Houston is an equal opportunity/affirmative action institution. Minorities, women, veterans and persons with disabilities are encouraged to apply.
