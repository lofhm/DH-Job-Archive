## Description
BackStory with the American History Guys is a nationally-distributed, weekly, one-hour public radio program hosted by three historians who explore the historical contexts of current events. BackStory seeks an energetic, thoughtful, and creative associate producer to join the show's production team. This individual will work with two other associate producers and a technical director, under the supervision of the program's senior producer, also reporting to an executive producer. The new associate producer will be responsible for all aspects of show production, including planning, research, scripting, studio and field recording, editing, and distribution of finished episodes. Duties also require extensive outreach to guest scholars, as well as in-depth research of show topics and cultivation of outside contributors for on-air content. Associate producers are responsible for maintaining BackStory's online and social media presence, and for creating and disseminating related multimedia content as appropriate. 

Competitive candidates will have extensive experience with audio and/or multimedia production software (preferably Pro Tools) and share a passion for making the study of American history accessible and relevant to a broad public audience. Applicants should possess excellent research, writing, conceptual, organizational, and decision-making abilities, have an active interest in current events, and feel comfortable engaging high-level humanities scholars and scholarship. A background or experience in the field of American history and journalism is preferred. 

The position is based at the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities in Charlottesville, Virginia; telecommuting is not an option. The new producer will be in place by September, 2012.
