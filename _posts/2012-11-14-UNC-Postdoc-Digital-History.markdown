## Description

The History Department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill invites applications for a two-year postdoctoral position in digital historical research and teaching, beginning July 1, 2013. Applicants should have received the PhD in History or a related discipline within the last five years, but the position is not limited to a specific chronological era or field of research.  This position is part of the Carolina Digital Humanities Initiative, which is supported by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.

 

We seek a scholar who applies digital technologies to research, graduate and undergraduate teaching, and engaged scholarship.  Such technologies might include the use of large data sources, database creation and management, data visualization, digital mapping, text mining and mark-up, and other related activities.  Duties for the position will include the teaching of one graduate and one undergraduate course per year, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the sharing of scholarship with non-academic audiences.  The person in this position will also contribute to ongoing projects in the Digital Innovation Lab.

 

To apply, please write to dighistpostdoc@unc.edu and submit a cover letter, CV, and writing sample from a research project.  Applicants must also provide a 2000 word statement about the project that would be pursued during the term of the postdoctorate, noting the role of this project in future career plans and how the work might be completed over a two year period; and it should include links to an example of the applicantâ€™s previous work with digital technologies.  Please include the names and contact information for four recommenders.

 

Inquiries may be directed to Professor Richard Talbert, Chair, Digital Humanities Search Committee, at  <dighistpostdoc@unc.edu>    Review of applications will begin on December 14, 2012 and continue until the position is filled.  The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is an EOE.
