## Description

GSLIS seeks to hire an outstanding full-time faculty member to join our iSchool. Strong candidates in any area relating to the organization, management, preservation, and retrieval of information, and the production and transmission of knowledge are encouraged to apply. We are particularly interested in specializations that directly contribute to our leading program in data curation, including cyber- infrastructure, scientific data management, workflow systems, provenance, data archiving, data science, digital humanities, e-Research and e-Science, and semantic technologies. A focus on data in any area of science or scholarship, including the social sciences and the humanities, is relevant.
 
We especially welcome applications from members of under-represented groups working in these or other areas of library and information science. GSLIS is a highly interdisciplinary unit and the successful candidate could hold degrees in information science, a social science, cognitive science or psychology, computer science, the humanities, a natural science, or other relevant disciplines. 
 
Ranked at no. 1 for many years GSLIS is an established national leader in both information science research and the preparation of information professionals. GSLIS offers MS and PhD degrees, a Certificate of Advanced Study (CAS), and participates in the University's undergraduate informatics minor, informatics PhD, and MS in Bioinformatics, and includes an award-winning online option (LEEP) for MS and CAS students. GSLIS faculty and students are involved in many initiatives across campus, including collaborations with world-renowned units such as the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) and the Institute for Computing in Humanities, Arts, and Social Science (I-CHASS). Our close relationship with scientific and cultural institutions ensures that our research both shapes practice and engages critical contemporary problems. 
 
At GSLIS data curation research and education is an area of emphasis for the Center for Informatics Research in Science and Scholarship (CIRSS). CIRSS supports an active portfolio of data curation research projects with a wide variety of institutional partners, collaborating with national data centers, other iSchools, leading research libraries, and cyberinfrastructure initiatives. GSLIS also sponsors data curation programs for both MS and PhD students. The GSLIS data curation specialization was the first LIS program to educate professionals in the curation of research data, providing students with the theory and skills necessary to work in the rapidly expanding number of academic and industry settings where this expertise is in demand. A specialization in data analytics, for both MS and PhD students, is also under development. 
 
Appointment will begin August 16, 2013 or as negotiated. Rank is open, and salary commensurate with qualifications. A Ph.D. degree or equivalent is required although candidates near completion will be considered. To apply create a candidate profile at <https://jobs.illinois.edu> and upload a letter of application, curriculum vitae, short research statement, list of three references including contact information. To ensure full consideration applicants must apply by **November 20, 2012.** Applicants may be interviewed before that date, but no hiring decisions will be made until after the search closes.
