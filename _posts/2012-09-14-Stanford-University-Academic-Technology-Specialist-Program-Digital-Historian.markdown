The ATS collaborates with faculty and graduate students developing and deploying innovative technological solutions in pursuit of research, teaching and publication. Rather than acting as a technical consultant, the ATS takes a leading role in launching new projects. Consequently, the ATS must demonstrate not only expertise with academic technology, but a fundamental understanding of the ideas that form the foundation of history and the humanities.

The ATS position falls within the rising tide of hybrid alternative academic (#alt-ac) careers. The ATS will have an office within the History department in order to assure proximity and availability to faculty, but will report to a manager in the Academic Technology Specialist Program (ATSP) a unit of Stanford University Libraries. The ATS will benefit from working at Stanford's Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA) and, more broadly, will be embedded in one of the world's leading interdisciplinary research universities in the heart of Silicon Valley. 

This is a full time position. An advanced degree in History is required, PhD preferred.
