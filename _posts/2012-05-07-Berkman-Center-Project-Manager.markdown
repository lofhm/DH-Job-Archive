She or he will join the Berkman Center’s world-class community of scholars and digital architects, and work in close collaboration with Berkman faculty, staff, and fellows to advance a range of interdisciplinary, cutting-edge research related to the study and development of Internet & society.

## Duties and Responsibilities

Reporting to the Associate Director of the Berkman Center, and working alongside Berkman’s growing team of project managers and project coordinators, the project manager will drive forward a diverse portfolio of research projects; support critical institutional initiatives; and provide high level, strategic management to project teams, focusing on systems/efficacy of the effort.

Working alongside Berkman’s growing team of project managers and project coordinators, the project manager will drive forward a diverse portfolio of research projects; support critical institutional initiatives; and provide high level, strategic management to project teams, focusing on systems/efficacy of the effort. She or he will perform research at the intersection of new technologies, law, policy, and society; analyze and translate data into written media; lead and initiate associated technical tasks and software development work; oversee student researchers; and assist in the implementation of various projects and events.

Although the suite of associated activities will evolve and vary over time according to Center priorities and needs, initial project work will likely center on Chilling Effects, an area of research focused on online First Amendment rights; Media Cloud, an open source, open data platform that allows researchers to answer quantitative questions about the content of online media; and other efforts with research, technical, and community-building components.

## Essential functions of the project manager will include: 
* leading, collaboratively undertaking and coordinating select research projects, including allocating resources, writing and communicating results, analyzing data, developing and driving plans and timelines in compliance with grant requirements 
* overseeing development and associated deployment of project-related supportive technologies, including interfacing with in-house application developers, external consultants, designers, and other contributors 
* cultivating and coordinating national and international research networks, and other partnerships, for project-specific work and the Center overall 
* supporting fundraising and grant management, including generating reports and proposals, and driving rich, strong and sustained external relationships with donors 
* planning workshops and other events, including coordination of relevant communications, in partnership with the core institutional team, and interacting with participants and organizers 
* managing the selection and oversight of student interns and research assistants
* contributing to select institutional activities and priorities, including conceiving and advancing improvements to the Berkman Center and its community.

Based on the fast-paced and changing needs of the Berkman Center, the project manager may be called upon for other tasks at short notice. Occasional evening and weekend work will be required, and travel opportunities may arise.

The right candidate will thrive in a committed, collaborative, and tight-knit community that encourages creativity, supports deep inquiry, values novel approaches to solving problems, strives for transparency, continually builds upon best-practices and lessons learned, and supports its community members’ independent and collective goals.

As with all Berkman appointments, this is a June 30, 2013 term-limited position; continuation anticipated but contingent upon funding and business needs.

## Basic Qualifications
Bachelor’s degree required; advanced degree in law, policy, social sciences, business, technology, or other relevant discipline is a plus, with 3+ years experience managing projects, engaging with policy and conducting research at the intersections of technology/regulation/social impact.

## Additional Qualifications
The project manager will have a broad skill set, including deft management abilities, project team coordination and experience with direct supervision and mentoring; extensive research and writing experience; adaptive workflow management; event planning and implementation; and outstanding writing and verbal skills.

In addition, the project manager will have outstanding interpersonal skills; a proven capacity to work independently and as a team member; sound judgment; and exceptional ethical standards.

Finally, the project manager will have heart, verve, and vigor; a can-do attitude; a very good sense of humor; and a strong desire to affect change in the world.

Strong preference for technological interest and experience, ideally managing projects that rely on technical tools or platforms, and experience with guiding technical development processes.

This project manager position would highly benefit from someone with strong quantitative/statistical skills.

Additionally, we seek someone who has worked in a fast-paced setting, be it academic/research, entrepreneurial, non-profit, or consultancy.
