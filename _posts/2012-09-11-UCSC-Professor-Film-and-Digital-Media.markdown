The Department of Film & Digital Media at the University of California, Santa Cruz, invites applications for a position in the theory, practice, and/or history of film and digital media at the rank of Associate Professor or Professor. Areas and media of specialization are open. We seek an accomplished and influential filmmaker, media artist, and/or scholar with a distinguished record of publications, exhibitions and/or screenings, whose modes of production and research intersect with and expand upon the department’s current strengths: nonfiction forms; media archaeologies; transnational media; race, gender and sexuality; media arts engaging issues of social justice and political activism; and creative experimentation across media forms and platforms. A Ph.D., M.F.A., or other terminal degree is desired but not required for consideration; comparable career achievements and experience (including success through critical acclaim or in securing major grants and fellowships) may be considered equivalent qualification. All faculty in the department teach at both undergraduate and graduate levels; thus, candidates should be able to demonstrate how their research and teaching interests and experience will help foster the growth of an interdisciplinary master’s program in social documentation and a doctoral program in the critical practice of film and digital media.

The Film & Digital Media Department offers a Ph.D. designed to challenge traditional borders between creative and critical practice; an M.A. in Social Documentation aimed at training documentarians in creative and scholarly approaches to experience, representation, and argument; and a B.A. which emphasizes both critical studies and production. The Film & Digital Media Department is in the Division of the Arts, which also includes Departments of Art, History of Art and Visual Culture, Music, Theater Arts, the M.F.A. Program in Digital Arts and New Media, and Ph.D. programs in Music and Visual Studies. There are opportunities for scholarly and teaching connections in these areas, as well as with colleagues and programs in the Humanities and Social Sciences divisions and the School of Engineering. The Arts Division supports faculty research through the Arts Research Institute <http://artsresearch.ucsc.edu/ari/>; the campus supports research and teaching with grants awarded by the Committee on Research, the Committee on Teaching, and other groups.

We are especially interested in candidates who can contribute to the diversity and excellence of the academic community through their research, teaching and service. The campus currently operates on a schedule of three eleven-week quarters per academic year. This position entails: teaching five five-unit courses per year, or their equivalent, in accordance with the department's workload policy; advising and mentoring graduate and undergraduate students; actively engaging in research; and actively participating in administrative responsibilities for the department, affiliated college, and the campus.
