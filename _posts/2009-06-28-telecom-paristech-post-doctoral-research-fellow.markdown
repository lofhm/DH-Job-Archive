## Description




<p>We are looking for a candidate with experience in 3D computer graphics.<.p>

<h4>Topic:</h4>
<p>The project takes place within the ECA system Greta. This ECA system
accepts as input a text to be said by the agent. The text has been
enriched with information on the manner the text ought to be said (i.e.
with which communicative acts it should be said). The behavioral engine
computes the synchronized verbal and nonverbal behaviors of the agent.
The animation module follows the MPEG-4 and the H-Anim standards. This
work is part of the EU project CALLAS (http://www.callas-newmedia.eu/).
CALLAS aims to provide a new paradigm for investigating a more
comprehensive set of emotions in multimodal interfaces tailored to New
Media environments, changing the way we perceive contemporary and future
media applications.</p>

<p>The animation module designed so far has implemented arm movements only.
It needs to be extended to the full upper body, in particular to the
torso and shoulder. The body animation needs also to produce expressive
animations.</p>

<p>We are seeking for one candidate with knowledge in 3D computer graphics.
Having experience on 3D human body animation is a plus. The candidate
will participate in the project's research activities, and will assist
with the development of demonstration prototypes.</p>
