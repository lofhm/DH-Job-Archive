<p>We have no budget for advertising in any print medium, so we'd be grateful if list members who know of anyone who might be interested could pass on the information.</p>

<p>A couple of additional points that aren't in the official advertisement</p>

<p>1) In case the job title of "Technical Support Officer" causes people to run a mile before they even look at the (equally unalluring) salary, let me stress that this title is merely to fit into the UK academic appointments structure. The work has absolutely nothing to to with "tech support" in the "help, where's my toolbar gone?" sense. It's really all encoding plus a bit of general organisation. </p>

<p>2) The realities of European Union employment/immigration policy mean that it would be extremely difficult to get a work permit for a post at this level for anyone other than an EU national (or maybe a national of a front-tier aspirant state).</p>
