## Description


<p>The Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) at the
University of Maryland in College Park seeks a web programmer to work
on two grant funded projects. The first involves the creation of a
collaboratively-edited database of 3-dimensional models of historical
theater buildings. The second will integrate MITH's web-based
multimedia annotation tool (AXE) into the Center for History and New
Media's world-renowned citation management system, Zotero. Both are
potentially very high profile projects in the digital humanities and
it is likely this one year appointment will lead to other exciting
opportunities in the digital humanities.</p>

<p>The successful candidate will at the minimum have a bachelor’s degree
and will be proficient in PHP, XML, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS.
Familiarity with cross browser compatibility issues and the ability to
work well individually and in a team environment and to produce
high-quality work under tightly defined deadlines is also essential.
The ideal candidate will also have thorough knowledge of SVG (scalar
vector graphics), ActionScript 3.0, and the Yahoo User Interface
(YUI).</p>

<p>Located in McKeldin Library at the heart of the campus, MITH is the
University of Maryland’s primary intellectual hub for scholars and
practitioners of digital humanities, new media, and cyberculture.
MITH’s house research includes projects in text mining, tool building,
visualization, digital libraries, electronic publishing, and digital
preservation. We collaborate actively with allied campus units,
including the University Libraries, the College of Information
Science, and the Human Computer Interaction Lab. Situated in a suburb
of Washington DC, MITH also offers all of the opportunities that come
from the libraries, museums, and cultural institutions of the area.</p>

<p>Salary range: $45,000 - $55,000, commensurate with experience. The
University also offers a comprehensive benefits package, including 22
Days Annual Leave; 15 Days Sick Leave; 3 Days Personal Leave; 15 Paid
Holidays; Tuition Remission; Health, Dental, Vision and Prescription
coverage. This is a full time (40 hrs/week) position on a one year
appointment. Consideration of applications to begin immediately and
will continue until the position is filled. To apply, please send a
letter of application, CV, and the names, addresses, and current phone
