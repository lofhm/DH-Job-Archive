##Description
We are seeking to hire a research fellow with a degree in Library and/or
Information Science, or an arts, humanities or social science discipline in
which the candidate has acquired significant research and practical
expertise in the area of digital curation. The ideal candidate should
provide evidence of past practical experience in digital curation and
possess a clear research and/or creative work agenda in which digital
curation is the central activity. We seek to hire someone who has earned a
graduate degree within the past three years that emphasizes digital
archiving, preservation and curation. A Ph.D. is preferred, but strong
candidates with M.A. or M.S. degrees also will be considered.

During his/her tenure as a digital curation fellow, the person hired will:
1) curate an original or collaborative project on campus; 2) make
occasional campus presentations about the subject of digital curation and
its value across disciplines; (3) conduct a graduate seminar, open to
graduate students from multiple disciplines, surveying research and best
practices within the field of digital curation; and (4) advise faculty and
administrators on the development of curriculum in the field of digital
curation.

The person hired would provide outreach to various constituencies on
campus, particularly visual artists, musicians, journalists, filmmakers,
librarians, museum curators and archivists who seek to acquire curation
skills for creating digital archives of primary data (image, sound,
text), and for accessing, analyzing, and presenting such data.

## Qualifications
M.A. or M.S. degree (2008 or later) with emphasis in digital archiving, preservation and curation. 
Evidence of highest degree earned will be required at time of hire. Ph.D. preferred.


The salary would be US $50,000 per year for a two-year contract. Full
faculty benefits would be provided for the period of the contract.

Screening of applications will begin **May 1, 2012** and will continue until
the position is filled. For guidelines on applying, go to: <http:www.jobsatcu.com>.
