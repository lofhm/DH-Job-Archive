## About the Program
CLIR is currently accepting applications for this program. All applications must be submitted using the online form on the For Applicants page. Review of applications will begin on May 1, 2012, and continue until positions are filled. CLIR expects all positions to be filled by June 30, 2012. For further information please consult the For Applicants and FAQ pages.

The CLIR/DLF Data Curation Fellowship Program is an expansion of CLIRâ€™s Postdoctoral Fellowship Program in Academic Libraries. CLIR/DLF Data Curation Fellowships will provide recent Ph.D.s with professional development, education, and training opportunities in data curation for the sciences and social sciences. Through these fellowships, CLIR seeks to raise awareness and build capacity for sound data management practice throughout the academy.

In its pilot year, 2012-2013, CLIR will recruit six fellows in cooperation with its partner institutions: Indiana University, Lehigh University, McMaster University, Purdue University, The University of California Los Angeles, and The University of Michigan.

CLIR will host a two-week immersion seminar for the CLIR/DLF Data Curation Fellows and their colleagues in the Postdoctoral Fellowship for Academic Libraries in July 2012, followed by periodic online and in-person meetings throughout their fellowship appointments.
