The School of Information at the University of Michigan (UMSI) seeks a tenure-track professor at any rank with expertise in interpretivist methods and theory who advances knowledge about the interactions between people, information and information technology.

While we encourage applications from both foundational and applied interpretivist researchers, we are particularly interested in candidates who are not merely consumers of ethnographically based methods, but who have deep expertise in at least one relevant theoretical literature as well as methods. For a brief background statement of the interpretivist perspective see <http://www.qualres.org/HomeInte-3516.html>, but we encourage candidates from other interpretivist traditions as well.

For all UMSI positions, we favor candidates whose research interests complement our existing expertise in such areas as computer-supported cooperative work; digital archives and preservation; human-computer interaction; incentive-centered design and information economics; information seeking, sharing and use; Internet-scale data, network and text analysis; social computing and informatics.

The mission of the School of Information is to create knowledge so people can use information and technology to build a better world, and to educate socially-engaged information professionals. A successful candidate will be committed to, and will directly contribute to our goal of being the best research and teaching institution for the understanding and design of information and its technologies in service of people and society.

The School is home to a dynamic and vibrant research and teaching program, with 35 FTE faculty, and over 400 students.  We offer a PhD, a Master of Science in Information, a Master of Health Informatics (jointly with the School of Public Health), a jointly offered undergraduate informatics major, and as of Fall 2014 we will offer our own bachelorâ€™s of information.

Founded in 1817, the University of Michigan has a long and distinguished history as one of the first public universities in the nation. It is one of only two public institutions consistently ranked among the nation's top ten universities. The University has one of the largest health care complexes in the world and one of the best library systems in the United States. With more than $1 billion in research expenditures annually, the University has the second largest research expenditure among all universities in the nation. The University has an annual general fund budget of more than $1.4 billion and an endowment valued at more than $7.57 billion.

## Qualifications:
* Ph.D. in an area such as sociology, anthropology, cultural studies, STS, information studies, information science, organizational studies, informatics, or related fields concerned with social analysis.
*   Demonstrated potential for successful teaching at the undergraduate and graduate level
*   Demonstrated potential for high scholarly impact
*   A strong commitment to teaching, interdisciplinary research, and cultural diversity

Review of applications will begin **November 1, 2012** and continue until the position is filled.
