## Description



<P>The School of Library, Archive and Information Studies at UCL is 
embarking on a vigorous expansion of the computer systems that 
underpin our teaching and research. The School offers teaching programmes 
in Information Management, Library and Information Studies, Information 
Science, Archives and Records Management, and Electronic Communication 
and Publishing. Computer-based research focuses on Internet technologies, 
user interface design, XML, EAD, digital library technologies for the 
humanities, and artificial intelligence applications. Our development 
plans include a series of short courses and new IT-based research 
projects, particularly in the humanities.</P>

<P>We are looking for an enthusiastic and versatile individual who will be 
responsible for the management of our computer systems and the 
development of our Web presence. The successful candidate will 
have knowledge of Windows 2000/NT4 system administration, Microsoft 
Office, HTML, and Web server technologies, and some programming 
experience. S/he will enjoy helping users at all levels from undergraduate 
students to senior staff, and be able to represent the School at computing 
events.</P>

<P>Some knowledge of XML, EAD, Unix, and library systems would be useful, 
as would an interest in the humanities, but this position provides an 
excellent opportunity for a motivated individual to gain a broad base 
of experience in this fast-developing area.</P>

<P>The position is available for one-year in the first instance with a salary 
of up to 25,213 plus London allowance of 2134.</P>

<P>To apply please submit a CV detailing relevant experience and 
covering letter to Kerstin Michaels, Administrator, School of 
Library, Archive and Information Studies, UCL, Gower Street, 
London WC1E 6BT, e-mail o.manager@ucl.ac.uk. Informal 
enquiries may be addressed to Susan Hockey, 
s.hockey@ucl.ac.uk, phone 020 7679 2477.</P>
