Canada Research Chair (Tier 2) in Digital Humanities

The Faculty of Arts at McGill University invites applications for a Canada Research Chair (Tier 2) in Digital Humanities. The successful candidate will have the academic credentials necessary for a tenure-track appointment as an advanced Assistant or Associate Professor in an appropriate disciplinary department. 

Funded by the Government of Canada, Tier 2 Canada Research Chairs allow Canadian universities to attract and retain exceptional emerging researchers. Chairholders are also eligible for infrastructure support from the Canada Foundation for Innovation to help acquire state-of-the-art equipment essential to their work. For further information on the CRC program, please see http://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca/.

We seek a scholar with a proven record of securing external funding to support digital humanities initiatives and the ability to build institutional capability in this area at McGill. The successful candidate will have a broad understanding of the history, significance, and application of digital technologies in one or more substantive areas of the humanities, including a demonstrated interest in the development of new digital tools and innovative methodologies. Along with critically exploring how digital technology can augment the practice of humanities scholarship, the CRC in Digital Humanities will advance the role humanities scholarship plays in developing our understanding of digital media in one or more of the domains of culture: art, literature, film, theatre, sound, architecture, and/or other media or forms of expression.

Applications should include a letter of interest, curriculum vitae, writing samples, evidence of teaching effectiveness, and three letters of reference. The position start date is August 1, 2011. Review of applications will begin on February 11, 2011, and will continue until the position is filled. 

PLEASE FORWARD SUPPORTING MATERIALS TO:

Professor Juliet Johnson
Associate Dean, Faculty of Arts
McGill University
853 Sherbrooke Street West
Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3A 2T6

All qualified candidates are encouraged to apply; however Canadians and permanent residents will be given priority. McGill University is committed to equity in employment and diversity. It welcomes applications from indigenous peoples, visible minorities, ethnic minorities, persons with disabilities, women, persons of minority sexual orientations and gender identities and others who may contribute to further diversification.
