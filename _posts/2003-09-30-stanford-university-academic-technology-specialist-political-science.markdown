The ATS will be located in the Political Science Department to assure proximity and availability to faculty. The ATS will have a background in Political Science and/or the social sciences in order to promote and assist the faculty with the discipline-specific educational and research tools available and disseminate knowledge of these tools appropriately through the department. He/she must have a thorough knowledge of statistical applications and data analysis. He/she should have some programming knowledge, be resourceful and creative in using current technologies, and demonstrate excellent organizational, instructional, and communication skills. The ATS will have a proven record of developing technology solutions and teaching others how to employ these solutions. The ATS will actively encourage and support the use of educational and research technology. He/she must have a willingness and interest in working with faculty at different levels of technical experience and expertise. </p>
