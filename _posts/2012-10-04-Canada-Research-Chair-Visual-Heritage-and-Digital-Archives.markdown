## Description

Concordia University in Montreal, Quebec, invites applications for an Emerging (Tier 2) Canada Research Chair (CRC) in Visual Heritage and Digital Archives (Film Studies) in the Faculty of Fine Arts. The goal of the CRC program is to ensure that Canadian universities "achieve the highest levels of research excellence to become world-class research centres in the global, knowledge-based economy." 

We are seeking an emerging Canadian or international scholar (within 10 years of receiving the PhD) of cultural and film history, working at the intersection of old and new media technologies. The candidate will display promising and innovative investigations into the circulation, preservation and display of audio-visual cultures and their material remnants, and consider the challenges and opportunities presented by new technologies in understanding past and present audiovisual phenomena, broadly defined.

Possible areas of specialization may include: technological, aesthetic, and cultural dynamics of moving image and sound formats of storage, transmission, and display across media; new models for on-line, digital, multimedia and interactive scholarship, publishing, and archiving; Quebec and Canada's audio-visual heritage; global heritage in relation to audiovisual production; intellectual property and the related business and legal infrastructures of moving images; history and theory of archives. Attention to matters of difference (in gender, ethnicity, sexuality, language) as they subtend to the above areas are encouraged.

The successful candidate will have an outstanding record of research and publication in a relevant field and have demonstrated ability to foster sizable interdisciplinary initiatives; attract and mentor excellent graduate students; and secure external funding. The candidate will be expected to take a leadership role in continuing to build the research culture of the department and its graduate programs.

The successful candidate for the CRC in Visual Heritage and Digital Archives will be appointed at the rank of Assistant or Associate Professor. The candidate will work with the Faculty of Fine Arts to prepare the formal CRC application according to the CRC program guidelines. The university will nominate the successful candidate to the CRC Secretariat at the earliest opportunity according to the guidelines of the CRC program.

Concordia's academic culture celebrates leading-edge research, creativity, and the transfer of knowledge for today's innovation-driven society. The Chair in Visual Heritage and Digital Archives will build on Concordia's leadership in the fields of art, communication and culture, as well as information and communication technologies as described in our Strategic Research Plan (2008-12). This Chair will join related projects underway at the university devoted to art and technology (Hexagram), gaming (TAG), oral history, digital poetics, feminist media studies and screen cultures. A Canada Research Chair entails a reduction of standard teaching load, research and salary stipends, as well as access to infrastructure grants for the duration of the five-year chair, renewable once, for a total of 10 years.

Concordia is located in one of North America's most diverse, creative and livable cities. The Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema--Canada's largest university-based centre for the study of film animation, film production and film studies--has an enviable international reputation that continues to provide a benchmark for innovation and quality. The School's Film Studies programs are in great demand as a highly interdisciplinary domain of study situated within the globalization of culture, knowledge and technology. A young PhD program as well as a vibrant MA in Film Studies provides a rich context for advanced, critical study of the moving image, as well as for innovative and sustainable research programs in a variety of areas crucial to the rapidly changing field of film study.

### Instructions
Submissions must include a covering letter, a curriculum vitae, copies of recent publications, a one-page statement of teaching philosophy and interests, a one-page statement of research achievements, evidence of teaching effectiveness, and the names and contact information of three referees, one of which must be the candidate's department chair or dean or someone in a direct supervisory role. A detailed five-year research plan, appropriate to the goals and objectives of the CRC program, will be required of all finalists.
