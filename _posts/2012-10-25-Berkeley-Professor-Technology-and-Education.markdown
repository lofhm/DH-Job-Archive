## Description:

The Graduate School of Education (GSE) and the School of Information (I School) at the University of California, Berkeley jointly seek applicants for a tenure-track (assistant professor) position in technology and education to begin in July 2013.

The Graduate School of Education is home to an interdisciplinary group of scholars who merge cognitive, developmental, and social perspectives to study cognition and learning, and who have a deep interest in the ways that new technologies stand to transform teaching and learning and enhance access to education. The School of Information is the university's newest graduate professional school, with an interdisciplinary research faculty committed to the study of information and to improving its usability, reliability, and credibility while preserving security and privacy. We are excited about welcoming a new colleague in this rapidly expanding field.

We are looking for a scholar who conducts research on the design and/or use of new technology and digital media to advance innovation and enrich teaching and learning in schools and in other learning environments. Examples of possible research specializations are: computational and digital literacies and their significance for individuals and communities with a focus on issues of equity (e.g., issues related to digital divides, intersection of new media and globalization, teacher education and digital media); instructional systems design and online education; computer-mediated collaborative learning; the design of learning environments; user-interface design (e.g., Natural User Interfaces) in education; intelligent agents and systems for teaching and learning; simulation and immersive learning environments; and educational data mining/learning analytics in K-12 learning environments. The scholar would contribute to both academic and professional programs by teaching courses, leading research groups, and mentoring graduate students.

###Qualifications include:

* a doctoral degree or equivalent in a relevant field such as education, media studies, communication, computer science, learning science, cognitive science, information studies, or a related field, and
* the potential for significant research accomplishment and for distinguished teaching.
* The doctoral degree must be completed by date of hire.

###Applications must include:

* a curriculum vitae;
* a statement of interests and qualifications;
* up to three samples of academic writing;
* optionally, sample artifacts, such as educational media (e.g., a URL of an applet); and
* the names and contact information of three references.
* All letters will be treated as confidential per University of California policy and California state law. Please arrange for letters of recommendation to be uploaded directly by recommenders. Please refer potential referees, including when letters are provided via a third party (i.e., dossier service or career center), to the UC Berkeley statement of confidentiality: <http://apo.chance.berkeley.edu/evalltr.html>

To apply, please submit all materials electronically, by **January 4, 2013**, to the following URL:
