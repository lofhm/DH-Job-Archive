## Description


The University of Virginia's Institute for Advanced Technology is currently recruiting an XML/SGML publishing specialist, full-time, competitive salary and benefits.  A successful candidate would need to have strong skills in markup languages and related standards and technologies such as XSL, Unicode, etc..  Experience with Dynaweb would be a plus, but is not required.  Willingness to act as a backup systems administrator is necessary, but previous experience in systems administration is less important than expertise in markup and publishing technologies.  Candidates need not be in Virginia, and some support is available for moving expenses.

If you are interested, please contact University of Virginia Human
Resources' friendly and responsive recruiting staff, at UVAjobs@virginia.edu or by phone at 434-924-4444.  Please inform them of your interest in Job Vacancy Announcement #18744.  You may also correspond directly with John Unsworth, by email, at jmu2m@virginia.edu.
