## Description



<p>The Department of Humanistic Informatics has a fulltime, six-month position as an assistant or associate professor (førstelektor) available for the autumn semester of 2005. The successful candidate will teach a course on web programming for 12-15 weeks, six hours a week, to a group of 15-20 students, and would be responsible for some student advising. The rest of the time is for self-determined research. We would prefer a research with a PhD, but might consider someone who’s close to completing a PhD. With the dollar at its current low, the pay amounts to approximately US$ 5000 a month for a person with a PhD or US$4000 a month without a PhD.</p>

<p>The course to be taught involves XML and PHP. The major compulsory student activity last year was building a web application to query an XML-tagged text by Shakespeare. So far the course has been largely practical, but we’ve considered making it more theoretical, and are interested in ideas for developing the material. Teaching would be in a Scandinavian language or in English.</p>
