##Description
 
The Wired! Lab for Digital Historical Visualization at Duke University seek applicants for a postdoctoral (or equivalent) fellowship focusing on scholarship and pedagogy in the visualization of historical material culture and the built environment using new tools, techniques, and methods of digital and spatial research.
 
Applicants' own research should involve the sophisticated use of one or more of the following: mapping and geo-spatial analysis; spatial and temporal visualizations using 3D modeling and photogrammetry; computer-aided drawing tools (CAD) and data visualization. Interest and experience in leveraging interactive multimedia in scholarly communications and pedagogy is a plus. Applicants must be comfortable working in a collaborative research setting and have experience successfully participating in project management, curricular, and tool building teams.

##Requirements

We welcome applicants from art history, archaeology, architectural history, history, urban studies, anthropology, and geography, as well as candidates from computer science or the interpretive social sciences with a strong interest and experience in multidisciplinary methods and the humanities. The area of historical specialization is open, but there is a strong preference for candidates who offer areas or specializations which are complementary to those of existing faculty affiliated with the Wired Lab.
 
This postdoctoral fellow's time will be split between pursuing an original project (a research, tool-building, or scholarly communications project), and collaborating with and mentoring other researchers, including faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates in the Wired Lab. The postdoctoral fellow will also teach one course each year in the fields of digital and spatial scholarship or contribute pedagogical modules to a range of existing classes in the Department of Art, Art History & Visual Studies.
 
The appointment is for twelve (12) months but may be renewed for an additional year.
Open to applicants who will have received the PhD within five academic years previous
to the year of the award; persons holding tenure-track appointments are ineligible to
apply.
 
Applications will be considered through **June 15, 2012**. Start date is August 27, 2012.
 
For further information please contact: Agnieszka Witczak-Das, (919) 684-2438 or <mailto:agnieszka.witczak-das@duke.edu>
 
**Applicants should submit the following dossier materials as a single PDF file:**
* Cover letter;
* Curriculum Vitae;
* Research Project Proposal: A 150 word abstract, accompanied by a detailed narrative statement (no more than 1000 words) describing the research project the applicant plans to undertake during the term of the fellowship. The narrative statement should explain how the proposed project would make a contribution to the applicant's research and advance their larger field of study; the anticipated outcomes of the proposed research (including names of potential journals or publishers); a timetable for completion of the proposed project during the term of the fellowship; and the implications of the project for digital historical scholarship more broadly.
* Dissertation abstract;
* Writing Sample: (no more than 25-pages);
* Sample of Digital Scholarship: The applicant should provide a link to a sample of his or her digital scholarship;
* The names and contact information for three references. These references should be established scholars who are familiar with the applicant's work and the proposal being made for the fellowship. At least two of these references must be scholars who can speak to the applicant's engagement with the field of digital
humanities.
