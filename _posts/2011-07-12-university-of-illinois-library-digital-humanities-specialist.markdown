100% Academic Professional Position
University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign Library
 
 
Duties and Responsibilities: The University of Illinois Library conducts a variety of activities in support of digital humanities scholarship, including creation, delivery, curation and preservation of a wide variety of types of digital assets and tools. Reporting to the Technical Architect for Repositories and Scholarly Communication, the Digital Humanities Specialist will assist with the planning, implementation and ongoing production of these digital collections and scholarly initiatives, with particular emphasis on project design, digitization workflows, and content and delivery systems. The successful candidate will work across a number of humanities and Special Collections units and will be part of a team of IT personnel that develops and delivers repository and scholarly communication services. Examples of ongoing projects include a robust newspaper digitization program and a “triple-decker” nineteenth-century American novel digital conversion project, utilizing content management systems such as Olive, Archon, CONTENTdm, and locally developed databases. In addition, the successful candidate will contribute to the work of the Scholarly Commons in helping to articulate the relationship between new technologies and humanities scholarship to the community of humanists; in advising teaching faculty on the creation of digital objects and providing technical support for use of analytical tools; and in serving as an agent between content providers and the Library’s repository. This position is expected to evolve in tandem with the Library’s strategic goals and to experiment with new ways of supporting and enhancing the teaching, research and service missions of the University. The scope and responsibilities will shift in accordance with priorities established by the AUL for Information Technology Planning and Policy in consultation with IT staff and digital humanities stakeholders.
