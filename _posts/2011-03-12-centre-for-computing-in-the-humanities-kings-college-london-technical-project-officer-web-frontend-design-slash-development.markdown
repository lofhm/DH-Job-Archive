## Description

<p>The Centre for Computing in the Humanities (CCH) wishes to recruit a Lead Web Frontend Designer / Developer to work with and support the CCH development team and subject discipline specialists in the design and development of visually attractive and functionally effective web interfaces. </p>

<p>As part of its very active research programme, the Centre (a department within the School of Arts and Humanities) is involved in a large number of externally funded collaborative research projects, almost all of which are published as freely available websites. The department has built and hosts some 140 websites, of which around 35 are in active development at any one time. The successful candidate will be involved in supporting work on existing and new projects, collaborating on the design, customisation and maintenance of their web interfaces (both public facing and administrative), ensuring consistently high standards of usability and performance across the department's websites, and advising internally on standards and best practices. This is an exciting and varied position, which will involve taking the lead in aesthetic and functional design, and frontend development, across a diverse selection of different websites and applications which range from bespoke web application frameworks designed to display large amounts of complex or unusual data, to customising off-the-shelf blogging and CMS software. </p>

<p>Applicants must have a keen eye for effective visual design and layout, outstanding attention to detail, and a passion for creating attractive and robust interfaces.  Experience with Adobe Photoshop (or similar) together with developer level expertise in XHTML, CSS and JavaScript (including experience with AJAX development), are essential for this role. Applicants must have experience building interfaces and developing client-side functionality in the context of current programming or templating languages (e.g. Django, PHP, JSTL, XSLT etc). An awareness of interface development frameworks both for XHTML/CSS (such as Blueprint, YUI etc) and for JavaScript (preferably JQuery) would be highly desirable.  A working knowledge of user-centred design methodology (including development of wireframe diagrams, sitemaps, functional specifications) is important, and experience with user engagement processes such as the development of use cases or running focus groups would be a distinct advantage. A comprehensive knowledge of new and current standards and best practices for usable and accessible web interface design, together with the ability to systematically and quickly test for, identify, and resolve browser-related problems, is also expected.</p>

<p>Candidates must be able to demonstrate applicable experience in a web design/development role elsewhere and will be asked to supply examples of projects or websites they have worked on in the recent past which demonstrate both visual design and development competence.   background or interest in the cultural heritage sector and/or the fields of the Humanities or Social Sciences would be an advantage. </p>

<p>The successful candidate will need to be able to work effectively as part of a collaborative team (including working with external designers, project partners, and stakeholders) as well as being able to work independently. Candidates should have good communication skills and possess the ability to document the work in clear written English.</p>

<p>The appointment will be made, dependent on relevant qualifications and experience, within the Grade 6 scale, currently £33,070 - £39,038, per annum, inclusive of £2,323 London Allowance, per annum. Benefits include an annual season ticket loan scheme and a final salary superannuation scheme.</p>

<p>The closing date for receipt of applications is 11 March 2011</p>
