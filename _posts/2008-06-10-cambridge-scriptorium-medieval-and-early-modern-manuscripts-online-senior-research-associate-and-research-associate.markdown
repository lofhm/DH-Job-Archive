## Description


<p>Senior Research Associate and Research Associate
Vacancy Reference No: GG03380 Salary: GBP 34,793 - GBP 44,074
or GBP 25,888 GBP 33,780
</p>
<p>

Limit of tenure applies. Final year of research project.
</p>
<p>

Cambridge University, in association with the
Arts and Humanities Research Council, wishes to
appoint one Senior Research Associate and one
Research Associate, both for a period of one
year, with effect from 1 October 2008, to its
project entitled Scriptorium: Medieval and Early
Modern Manuscripts Online, based in the Faculty
of English <http://scriptorium.english.cam.ac.uk>.
</p>
<p>

Candidates will need high-level bibliographical,
codicological, and palaeographical skills
relevant to English manuscript study in the
period 1450 - 1720, and should be familiar with
(or ready to develop expertise in) HTML and XML,
as well as javascript and database-driven
projects, and the processing and handling of
digital images. The SRA and RA will be
responsible for organizing colloquia and handling
project communications, and for co-ordinating
manuscript-based research, developing both
electronic and print outputs, and producing
written research at the highest level; candidates
therefore must have a doctorate in a relevant
period and discipine (or comparable research
excellence), experience in handling medieval
and/or early modern manuscripts, and excellent
oral and written communication skills. Those with
a proven research record, and with experience
with one or more of the manuscript subject areas
(e.g. English and/or Latin poetry, heraldry, law,
medicine, theology), will be preferred.
Faculty-based mentoring will be available.
</p>
<p>

Further details and an application form for both
posts can be downloaded from the English Faculty
website or obtained from the Secretary to the
Appointments Committee, Faculty of English, 9
West Road, Cambridge, CB3 9DP (tel: 01223 335074,
email: va215@cam.ac.uk). Candidates should
indicate in their application whether they wish
to be considered for one or both posts.
</p>
<p>

Referees should be asked to write directly to the
Secretary to reach the Faculty by the closing
date of 6 June 2008. Interviews will be held on 27 June 2008.
