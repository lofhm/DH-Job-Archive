## Description






<p>The Science, Technology and Society Program at the University of
Alberta invites applications for an entry-level tenure-track position
as Assistant Professor. To fill this position, we are looking for a
candidate in any area of the social study of science and/or technology
whose research and teaching interests will enable a joint appointment
to be made in the Science, Technology and Society Program and one of
the following departments: the Department of Sociology, the Department
of Anthropology or the Department of Political Science. Qualified
candidates should hold a doctoral degree, or be close to completion,
and demonstrate outstanding potential for a research and teaching
career. Preference will be given to candidates whose research and
teaching interests complement those of existing faculty members.
Responsibilities will include teaching in both undergraduate and
graduate student programs and maintaining an active research program.</p>


<p>The Science, Technology and Society Program is one of a group of
recently established interdisciplinary programs based in the Office of
Interdisciplinary Studies in the Faculty of Arts at the University of
Alberta.</p>


<p>Established in 1908 as a board-governed, public institution, the
University of Alberta has earned the reputation of being one of the
best universities in Canada based on our strengths in teaching,
research, and services. The University of Alberta serves over 36,000
students in more than 200 undergraduate programs and 170 graduate
programs (www.ualberta.ca/). The Faculty of Arts is the oldest and
most diverse faculty on campus, and one of the largest research and
teaching centres in western Canada (www.arts.ualberta.ca). The
Universityâ€™s main campus is located in Edmonton, the vibrant,
cosmopolitan capital of the province of Alberta. The Edmonton
metropolitan area is the sixth largest in the country with a
population of approximately one million (www.edmonton.ca). Edmonton is
located only a few hours drive from Banff and Jasper National Parks,
which offer skiing in winter and excellent hiking and sightseeing in
summer.</p>


<p>Salary is commensurate with qualifications and experience. Inquiries
concerning this position may be directed to the Director of the
Science, Technology and Society Program, Professor Robert Smith, at
rwsmith@ualberta.ca .</p>


<p>Applicants should send a curriculum vitae, a letter describing their
areas of research interest, samples of publications, and, if
available, a teaching dossier and evaluations of teaching performance
to:</p>


<p>Professor Robert Smith
<br />Director, STS Program
<br />Office of Interdisciplinary Studies
<br />1-17 Humanities Building
<br />University of Alberta
<br />Edmonton
<br />Alberta  T6G 2E5</p>


<p>Applicants should also arrange for three letters of reference to be
sent to Professor Smith.</p>


<p>Closing date: October 1, 2008. The effective date of employment will
be July 1, 2009.</p>


<p>All qualified candidates are encouraged to apply; however, Canadians
and permanent residents will be given priority.</p>


<p>The University of Alberta hires on the basis of merit.  We are
committed to the principle of equity in employment. We welcome
diversity and encourage applications from all qualified women and men,
including persons with disabilities, members of visible minorities,
