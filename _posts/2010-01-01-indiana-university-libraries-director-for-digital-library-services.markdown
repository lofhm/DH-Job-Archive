## Description

<p>
The Indiana University Bloomington Libraries are seeking an experienced, visionary, and 
creative leader for the position of Director for Digital Library Services. This position 
reports to the Associate Dean for Library Technologies and manages the project and 
collection building services of the Indiana University Digital Library Program (DLP) 
(http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/), one of the nation's premier organizations for the creation 
and support of digital library resources and infrastructure, with production level support 
for locally produced digital library collections and responsibility for advancing the state of 
the art in digital library research. 
</p>

<p>The DLP is a department within the Library Technologies Division, a division focused on 
the innovative development and maintenance of technology in support of the mission of 
Indiana University and its world-renowned libraries. The Director for Digital Library 
Services has six direct reports including two librarians (Metadata Librarian and Digital 
Projects and Usability Librarian). Currently the entire Library Technologies Division is 
undergoing an organizational restructuring and this position will be key in developing, 
along with the Associate Dean for Library Technologies and the Director for Library 
Technology Services, a strategy that leverages institutional resources, production level 
capabilities and research and development initiatives into a cohesive infrastructure that 
supports next generation library services and transformational operational advantages for 
technology integration. DLP is a joint collaboration between the Libraries, University 
Information Technology Services (UITS), and the Indiana University research faculty with 
leadership from the School of Informatics, and the School of Library and Information 
Science.</p>

<p>Staff members within the DLP are responsible for offering services and creating online 
resources in support of teaching and research initiatives at Indiana University. The DLP 
provides services, tools, and online resources to collaborative partners both within and 
outside the university. Internal collaborators include the Institute for Digital Arts and 
Humanities (IDAH) (http://www.indiana.edu/~idah/), academic departmental partnerships 
with History and Philosophy of Science, English, etc., and special collections library 
partners such as the Lilly Library (rare books and manuscripts), the Indiana University 
Archives and others. External collaborations as part of the Committee on Institutional 
Cooperation (http://www.cic.net.Home.aspx), Digital Library Federation 
(http://www.diglib.org/) initiatives and grant-driven projects with partner academic and 
cultural heritage institutions are quite common. The DLP also plays a significant role in 
the university's work on the HathiTrust digital library and repository 
(http://www.hathitrust.org/) as well as in planning and implementation of the digital 
collections created through the Indiana University/Committee on Institutional Cooperation 
Google Book Digitization Partnership 
(http://www.cic.net/Home/Projects/Library/BookSearch/Introduction.aspx). In addition, 
DLP staff support special digital collections and resources such as the IN Harmony: Sheet 
Music from Indiana, Variations (digital audio and musical score digital library), Sound 
Directions, The Victorian Women Writers Project, the Archive of Institutional Memory, 
IUScholarWorks Institutional Repository and digital publishing services, numerous other 
visual resources collections, and significant collections of archival finding aids 
(http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/collections/index.shtml). The DLP also provides services in 
the areas of project planning, digital library software development, digitization, electronic 
text development, metadata, interface design and usability 
(http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/services/index.shtml).</p>

<p>The DLP has a strong track record in identifying and acquiring external grant funding for 
its projects in support of faculty and researchers at Indiana University and contributes to 
the Library's digital information retrieval and preservation activities. The DLP is actively 
involved in the use and development of both the Fedora and DSpace systems and is 
currently working with UITS on a data-publishing model that leverages university wide 
mass storage resources supported by the IBM hierarchal storage management system, 
HPSS. Current active grant projects are in the areas of audio preservation, the Functional 
Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR), Sir Isaac Newton's alchemical 
manuscripts, and federated resources on international commons subjects in the Digital 
Library of the Commons.</p>

<p>The Indiana University Bloomington Libraries (http://www.libraries.iub.edu) are among 
the leading academic research library systems in North America, providing strong 
collections, quality service and instructional programs, and leadership in the application 
of information technologies. The IU Libraries system consists of eighteen libraries on the 
Bloomington campus, five libraries in Indianapolis, and a library at each of the six 
campuses across the state. The IUB collections include more than 6.6 million books,

support every academic discipline on campus, with an emphasis in the humanities and 
social sciences. Users can access more than 400 databases, 43,000 electronic journals, 
and 224,000 electronic books, as well as locally developed digital content. The IUB 
Libraries are active members of regional and national associations and consortia including 
the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC), the Association of Research Libraries 
(ARL), Center for Research Libraries (CRL), the Digital Library Federation (DLF), and the
