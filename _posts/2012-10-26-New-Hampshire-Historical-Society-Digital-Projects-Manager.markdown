## Summary

The New Hampshire Historical Society seeks a full-time digital projects manager to help lead the evolution of the Society's digital collections and services and to take charge of a portfolio of digital initiatives, some under way and others ready to begin the planning stages. The position is planned to be in place for a period of three years, and may extend beyond that time.

The digital projects manager reports to the assistant executive director and will work closely with the collections stewardship, interpretation, and technology advisory teams to determine, plan, implement, and support the development of digital collections and web-based services. Team members include the Society's staff (collections, interpretation, development, and administrative), current and former trustees, outside consultants and vendors, and colleagues from partnering institutions. Priority initiatives currently under way or ready to enter the planning stages include the conversion to an integrated collections management software (MINT), and the development of an online public access system for the MINT collections catalog; the establishment of an institution-wide digital assets management system; the creation of an online resource center to engage schools and local historical societies; and the development of an online collaborative portal to share digital images and transcriptions of the collected papers of U.S. President Franklin Pierce.

###About the New Hampshire Historical Society

Founded in 1823, the New Hampshire Historical Society is the fifth-oldest historical society in the nation. It is the only institution devoted to saving, preserving, and sharing all aspects of New Hampshire's history.

The Society's mission is to educate a diverse public about the significance of New Hampshire's past and its relationship to our lives today. In support of this mission the Society collects, preserves, and interprets materials pertaining to New Hampshire history. It is an independent nonprofit organization that receives no financial support from the state government.

The Society's collections offer the most complete picture of the social, economic, political, and cultural history of over four centuries of life in New Hampshire. The collections include 31,000 objects, 50,000 bound volumes and pamphlets, 800,000 pages of 18th- and 19th-century newspapers, 500,000 pages of manuscripts, 15,000 ephemera items, 3,000 broadsides, 2,300 maps, and 200,000 photographs.

The Society is located in Concord, the state's capital city, and uses its collections and resources to serve thousands of adults and children each year through its research library, museum exhibitions, educational programs, and publications. Our school programs reach an average of 18,000 students annually, both on-site and in classrooms across the state. The Society publishes a semi-annual journal, Historical New Hampshire, and a variety of books for both general and specialized audiences.

The Society's annual operating budget of about $2 million is supported by 4,000 members and donors; an endowment of approximately $12 million, and earned income. The Society recently launched a comprehensive campaign to raise a total of $10.7 million, including $9.2 million in capital funds, with the dual objectives of expanding access to our collections and resources, while strengthening our financial position in both operations and capitalization.

The Society is governed by a representative citizen board of 22 trustees. The Society's staff of 13 full- and 29 part-time employees is supplemented by 80 volunteers. The Society has been accredited by the American Association of Museums since 1986.
