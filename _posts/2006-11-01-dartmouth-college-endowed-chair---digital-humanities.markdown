## Description









<p>Dartmouth College is pleased to announce the creation of a senior position in the Digital Humanities for a newly endowed Chair in innovative fields. The successful applicant should be committed to inter-disciplinary collaboration, technological innovation, and creating curricular links within the Humanities and across divisions.  The position offers the opportunity to define a new area of research and teaching, building on Dartmouth's existing strengths in the Humanities and Computing.  The field of research and teaching is open; we seek candidates with practical and/or theoretical expertise in one or several of the following disciplines in the Arts and the Humanities: visual arts, screen studies, new media, performance arts, music and sound, film, TV/Video, and literature. Expertise in computer hardware and/or software will be welcome but is not essential. The role of the Chair in Digital Humanities is intended to be broad in scope, potentially incorporating current or future initiatives in cyber-culture and the creation, performance, and critical study of digital arts, including a consideration of the socio-political and theoretical implications of new artistic technologies. The endowment for this Chair provides additional funds for projects involving research and teaching in the Digital Humanities. The successful candidate will be located in a single Dartmouth department or program, or jointly appointed to one or more departments or programs. Considerable flexibility exists regarding joint appointments, which may  cross departmental or even divisional boundaries. One of the most diverse institutions of higher education in New England, Dartmouth College is an equal opportunity/ affirmative action employer and has a strong commitment to diversity.  In that spirit, we are particularly interested in receiving applications from a broad spectrum of people, including women, persons of color, persons with disabilities, and veterans. The Search Committee will begin reviewing applications after October 1, 2006.</p>

<p>Applications will be considered until the position is filled. Please
