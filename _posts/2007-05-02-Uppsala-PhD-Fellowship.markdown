##Description
<h4>"Textual Criticism and the Sociology of Texts"</h4>

<p class="hft-paras">Applications are invited for a PhD fellowship in "Textual criticism and the
sociology of texts".</p>

<p class="hft-paras">The fellowship is funded by the Danish Agency for Science, Technology and
Innovation and is offered jointly through the Georg Brandes School at the
Department of Nordic Studies and Linguistics, Copenhagen University, and the
Department of Literature, Institute for the Sociology of Literature, Uppsala
University. The successful candidate will be expected to divide his or her
time between Copenhagen and Uppsala, and will be allocated a supervisor from
each institution, the principal supervisor however will be a professor or
associate professor from the University of Copenhagen.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">Funding is provided for a research project within the area known as "the
sociology of texts", meaning that texts are regarded not as abstract bearers
of meaning but rather as historical phenomena which have physical
manifestations and are the products of social interaction. This point of
view necessitates an awareness of the factors and agents which are involved
in the cultural processes of production, dissemination and reception, as
texts are constantly recast, re-issued and reinterpreted by different people
at different times.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">It is assumed that the research project will combine a theoretical
perspective with a specific body of texts. The research undertaken by the
PhD candidate might focus on one - or combine several - of  the following
areas:</p>

<ol>
	 <li>An historical investigation into the various agents involved in textual
production - paper-makers, printers, publishers etc. - and the working
methods and conventions developed in these areas, such as page layout, font
design, orthography and punctuation, marketing strategies and so on.</li>

<li>A study of the transmission of an individual work (e.g. a chapbook) or
group of works (e.g. those of a particular author).</li>

<li>Scholarly editing, including a discussion of the principles for the
establishment of the text and the provision of commentary.</li>

<li>A study of reception, including reviews and criticism in particular
periods and places, reading circles, the history of book collections and
libraries and patterns of readers' behaviour.</li>

<li>A consideration, from a text-sociological point of view, of traditional
literary-critical concepts such as the author, authorial intention,
authorisation, textual errors, the model and empirical reader, copyright,
censorship, literary genre and interpretation.</li>
</ol>

<p class="hft-paras">Applicants must possess a Master's Degree or the equivalent or expect to
possess one by May 1, 2007. All applicants must have submitted a thesis and
enclose an assessment of it along with the application.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">Appointment as a PhD fellow is subject to the rules of the Faculty of

of Finance and the Danish Confederation of Professional Associations (AC).</p>

payment - to accept work corresponding to 840 hours over a three-year
