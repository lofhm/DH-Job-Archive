## Description



<p>The University of Michigan Library's electronic-text group is looking for an editor/proofreader to work on the large etext projects that it is responsible for under the aegis of the 'Text Creation Partnership,' namely the full-text components of Early English Books Online, Evans Early Amerian Imprints, and (prospectively) Eighteenth-Century Collections Online. EEBO produces structurally tagged electronic transcriptions of pre-1700 English books; Evans (just beginning) of pre-1800 American books; and ECCO (still in our future) of 18th-century English books. EEBO alone, approaching 7000 texts completed so far on the way to 25,000, is probably the largest text corpus of its kind ever attempted; the three projects taken together are something quite unprecedented.</p>

<p>The new editor will join six others similarly employed--three at Michigan, three at Oxford. The job is a modestly-waged library staff position, not a faculty position, but it does offer a chance to read extensively in early books, to use and expand subject knowledge and technical skills, and a congenial work environment.</p>

<p>The official posting and job description can be found at: <a href="http://websvcs.itcs.umich.edu/jobnet/job_posting.php?postingnumber=037707">http://websvcs.itcs.umich.edu/jobnet/job_posting.php?postingnumber=037707</a></p>

<p>The official salary range (class 07) is $27,600 to $65,100, but candor compels me to say that the actual salary is likely, as usual, to fall towards the lower end of that range. The job is posted as a term appointment (through July of 06), with the possibility of extension dependent chiefly on the availability of funding.</p>

<p>For further information about the TCP projects, see <a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/eebo/">http://www.lib.umich.edu/eebo/</a> and <a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/evans/">http://www.lib.umich.edu/evans/</a></p>
