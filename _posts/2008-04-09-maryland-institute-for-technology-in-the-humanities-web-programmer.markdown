<p>The Maryland Institute of Technology in the Humanities (MITH) at the University of Maryland in College Park is seeking a full time programmer for at least a year to work on the NEH/JISC funded Shakespeare's Quartos project.  This exciting digital humanities initiative, an international collaboration among MITH, the Folger Shakespeare Library, Oxford University, the British Library, the Huntington Library, and the Scottish National Library, aims to create a digital archive of all the extant quartos of Shakespeare's plays beginning with Hamlet.  The successful candidate will at the minimum have a bachelor's degree and be an experienced web programmer familiar with PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, XML, and XSLT to develop both the user interface and the database back-end for this interactive archive. Ideally, the candidate will also have a background in textual criticism and Shakespearean scholarship.</p>

MITH’s house research includes projects in text mining, tool building, visualization, digital libraries, electronic publishing, and digital preservation. We collaborate actively with allied campus units, including the University Libraries, the College of Information Science, and the Human Computer Interaction Lab. Situated just outside of Washington DC, MITH also offers all of the opportunities that come from the libraries, museums, and cultural institutions of the area.</p>
