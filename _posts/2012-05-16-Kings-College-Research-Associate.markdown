##Summary: 
Applications are invited for a postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of History at King's College London, to participate in the ERC-funded project 'China and the Historical Sociology of Empire'. The postholder will have a background in the digital humanities and will be working under the supervision of Dr Hilde De Weerdt (Principal Investigator), with a project team consisting of two other postdoctoral research associates, and in collaboration with the Department of Digital Humanities at King's College and a network of international collaborators. The project aims to contribute towards a better understanding of the divergent courses of the political histories of Chinese and European polities in the second millennium through the historical analysis of political communication (in the broad sense of the circulation of information about political events and institutions). The project combines traditional philological and historical research methods with the use of biographical databases, historical geographic information systems (GIS), social network analysis (SNA), and digital text analysis and visualization.

The position is available from 1 September 2012 for a duration of four years. The Department of Digital Humanities at King's College London is world renowned for its range of expertise and projects supported. The History department has a great deal of expertise in working with digital resources projects in collaboration with Digital Humanities.

##Details: 
The Research Associate in East Asian Digital Humanities will conduct research and publish in an area relevant to the project (text mining-e.g., the automated mark-up and extraction of named entities in classical Chinese, or visualization in the digital humanities); consult on appropriate mark-up procedures; develop delivery and querying tools in collaboration with the Department of Digital Humanities; manage the project website; liaise with international experts; assist in the organization of a conference on visualization in the humanities. The Research Associate in East Asian Digital Humanities will be employed full time for 48 months. A Ph.D. in informatics or computing sciences, or a PhD. in a humanities subject together with expertise in the digital humanities is required. Familiarity with East Asian languages is desirable but not essential.

The postholder is expected to work at the KCL Strand campus.

**Salary:** The salary for this appointment is Grade 6, spine point 31 - &pound;31,020 per annum, plus &pound;2,323 London Allowance per annum.
