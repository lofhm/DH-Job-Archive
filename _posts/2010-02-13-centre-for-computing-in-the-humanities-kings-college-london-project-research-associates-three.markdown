## Description

<p>The Centre for Computing in the Humanities, King's College London is looking for three highly motivated and technically sophisticated individuals to work on its text-based research projects. The positions will involve using computer tools and methods to facilitate digital scholarship.</p>
<p>CCH is both a department with responsibility for its own academic programme and a research centre promoting the appropriate application of computing in humanities research. Its research projects cover a wide range of humanities disciplines, including medieval studies, history, literature and linguistics, and music, and also include a number of more general information management projects in both humanities and the social sciences.</p>
<p>The successful candidates will possess strong analytical and problem solving skills: they will be required to identify and engage with the core scholarly questions in a highly collaborative research context; to analyse a wide variety of humanities materials and to model them using XML-related technologies; to design and develop systems for editing and delivering text-based scholarly materials and to collaborate in the design of integrated HTML-based publication. Experience in creating and manipulating XML documents in a range of XML-related standards and technologies (DTDs, XPath, XSLT) is highly desirable, in particular textual materials encoded according to the Text Encoding Initiative's guidelines.</p>
<p>All successful candidates will need to have a good understanding of how research is conducted in the humanities and social sciences and will be expected to make a strong contribution to the departmental research profile. They will need to be able to work effectively as part of a team, as well as independently. They must have good communication skills and the ability to document their work in clear written English.</p>
<p>One position is for one year on Fixed Term Contract (Maternity Cover) – within the Grade 5 scale, currently £28,074 to £32,176, inclusive of London Allowance.

Two positions are for one year on Fixed Term Contract – within the Grade 6 scale, currently £30,070 to £39,038 per annum, inclusive of London Allowance.
</p>
<p>Closing date: 12th February 2010</p>
