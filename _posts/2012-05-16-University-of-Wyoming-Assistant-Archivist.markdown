##Description
The American Heritage Center (AHC) of the University of Wyoming is seeking a Digital Programs Archivist at the assistant archivist level. The AHC seeks a creative, dynamic, articulate, and out-going professional to manage its electronic records and mass digitization programs, and provide leadership on various web initiatives. Archivists at UW have faculty status with extended term appointments possible after five years. The archivist reports to the Associate Director of the AHC.

The AHC is a major research archive independent of the University's libraries, reporting directly to the Provost. The AHC is one of the largest and busiest modern manuscripts repositories in the U.S., and its professional employees have a strong track record of leadership and scholarship in archives administration, special collections librarianship, history, women's studies, and other fields. Recent emphasis at the AHC has been on minimal processing and cataloging, collection policy redefinition, and a reappraisal program. 

## Responsibilities
The Digital Programs Archivist will continue to evolve the AHC's electronic records program by developing, implementing, and executing processes enabling effective acquisition, appraisal, ingest, preservation, and management of born-digital archival collections. This position works closely with a variety of stakeholders, including Libraries, IT, donors, and archivists in other AHC departments (including University Archives). The Digital Programs Archivist will manage a very active mass digitization program, and provide leadership in the creation and delivery of digital content to meet the needs of the AHC's patrons and preservation priorities. This includes digitization of text, image, audio, and video formats. The archivist will also oversee ongoing development and maintenance of various AHC websites and initiatives. The archivist will be expected to remain current with emerging standards and professional best practices and be able to manage complex projects, coordinate multiple activities and tasks, and supervise 3 FTE staff as well as various student employees.

## Qualifications 
Required: Master's degree in Library Science, Information Science, Computer Science/Systems Management, History, or other allied discipline, with concentration reasonably equivalent to the SAA Guidelines for Archival Graduate Education.

Familiarity with design programs, e.g., Adobe Photoshop, Dreamweaver. Familiarity with common website management concepts. Experience using Digital Asset Management software. Familiarity with digitization standards and workflows. Demonstrated ability to plan, coordinate, and implement effective programs, complex projects, and services. Excellent organizational skills and a demonstrated ability to handle complex analytical and detailed work. Excellent oral and written communication skills. Ability to work independently and collaboratively in a complex and rapidly changing environment. Extremely collaborative and cooperative and communicative. Preferred: Experience obtaining grant funding and managing grant funded projects. Demonstrated competence with XSLT, Java, PERL and/or other scripting languages. Advanced knowledge and experience with electronic records programs in an archival setting. Experience in implementing records management programs, particularly working with private records. Experience in other common areas of archival practice, including collection development, donor relations, appraisal, archival processing, and outreach.
