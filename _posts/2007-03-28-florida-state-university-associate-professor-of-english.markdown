## Description
















<h3>Specialist in Humanities Computing and New Technology Approaches to Literature</h3>

<p>As part of a cluster of senior hires in the history of text technologies, we are seeking a specialist in humanities computing and new technology approaches to the study of English literary texts. Salaries competitive at both the national and international level. Ph.D. required. Although we would prefer to appoint at the level of tenured associate professor, we will consider qualified applicants at any rank. Normally tenure requires one published book, but "book" may be defined unconventionally in this case. Preference will be given to candidates who specialize in medieval or early modern texts, but given the small candidate pool we will happily consider applicants who work in any field of literature in English (including applicants interested in the impact of other languages and literatures upon English). The English department already hosts several journals, and has recently hired several specialists in new technologies; we already have a certificate program in Editing and Publishing, and are building a new interdisciplinary doctoral program in the transnational History of Text Technologies. The search will begin immediately and continue until the post is filled. Women and minority candidates are encouraged to apply. Please email applications or enquiries, including a c.v. and the email addresses of at least three references, to Professor:</p>
