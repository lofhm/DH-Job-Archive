## Description






<h3>Academic Technology Specialist, Visual Resources Center, Stanford University Libraries, Stanford University</h3>

<p>The Visual Resources Center (VRC) is one of several centers, schools and departments participating in the Academic Technology Specialists (ATS) Program which places technology experts with specific disciplinary training into departments where they can leverage their unique combination of skills to assists faculty in utilizing technology in the pursuit of their research and teaching goals.</p>

<p>The Visual Resources Center provides an image collection and image production services to support the instructional program of the Department of Art & Art History. Formerly aligned with the Department of Art & Art History (AAH), VRC was recently transferred to the Stanford University Libraries & Academic Information Resources (SUL/AIR), where it operates under the supervision of the Art & Architecture Library.  The VRC has over 300,000 35 mm slides and 24,000 digital images and is engaged in both slide and digital image production. The collection covers all aspects of the study of art and architecture, especially Greek & Roman, European, American, Chinese and Japanese. The transfer of VRC into the SUL/AIR system provides numerous opportunities to leverage a department-based visual resource operation into a campus-wide service facility.</p>

<p>The primary goals of the University -- teaching, learning, and research -- are centered on the accumulation and distribution of information among faculty, staff, and students, and the primary goal of the ATS is to support this mission through practical and creative uses of technology. An ATS position is multifaceted, and an ATS must be comfortable managing (juggling) a range of projects and duties that may include the development of complex web applications and/or databases on the one hand while assisting faculty in acquiring new technology skills.</p>

<p>The ATS will play a central role in strategic planning and program development as VRC works to enhance and significantly expand its existing operation. The ATS will be responsible for leveraging technologies to achieve efficiencies in the digital production process, developing a back-up system for the imagebase, and designing a stable production platform from which to move forward. The recent incorporation of a Film and Media Studies program into AAH will require the addition of a digital video service for instructional support. The VRC will also need to expand its technological infrastructure to support the curricular requirements for the Electronic Media Arts program. As these VRC services grow, the ATS will be responsible for designing, developing and deploying the necessary technology solutions including a major initiative to network the imagebase, and provide VRC services online to the larger Stanford academic community.</p>

<p>The ideal candidate will have a record of innovation and creativity in leveraging technology to make resources accessible, understandable, and appealing to an academic audience and demonstrated leadership and resourcefulness in identifying and integrating technological solutions to research and pedagogical needs. The ability to work closely and respectfully with VRC staff, Art & Architecture Library staff, under the supervision of the Head of the Art & Architecture Library, in an extremely collegial, service-based, and forward-looking operation, is essential.<p>
