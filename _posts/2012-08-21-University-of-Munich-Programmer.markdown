##Job Description
You will be responsible for the technical maintenance and development of the Dictionary of Gāndhārī database. Gāndhārī is a Middle Indo‐Aryan language used in ancient Gandhāra (northern Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan) and in Central Asia (Xinjiang, China) from ca. the fourth century BCE until the fourth century CE. As an important literary and administrative language of this region, Gāndhārī played a central role in the spread of Buddhist literature from India to Central Asia and China. The Dictionary database, established in 2002 at the University of Washington, currently contains transliterations and images of 2,635 Gāndhārī documents (manuscripts, inscriptions and coin legends) – the large majority of known sources for this language. At the same time, archeological discoveries continue to enlarge the Gāndhārī textual corpus, and only a small part of the currently known texts is available in scholarly editions. The Dictionary of Gāndhārī is thus being compiled on the basis of a growing body of sources, and the Dictionary database in turn supports ongoing editorial activities. Further information on the Dictionary of Gāndhārī is available at http://gandhari.org/dictionary/.

We are looking for an experienced programmer and digital humanist who will convert the content of the Dictionary database from its current custom PostgreSQL schema into a TEI‐conformant XML schema following specifications provided by the editors, and who will develop a hosting solution and web applications for this content on the basis of either a relational database or an eXist native XML database. After this fundamental format conversion, the programmer / digital humanist will continue to broaden and improve the presentational and analytical capabilities of the database system in accordance with the needs of its editors and users (including mechanisms for linking transcriptions and images of source texts, advanced search procedures taking into account lexical and grammatical metadata, and methods for integrating information from the database with editorial actions into full‐fledged dictionary articles and grammatical descriptions). The programmer / digital humanist will further assist with the typesetting of web and print publications of the project “Buddhist Manuscripts from Gandhāra,” with special attention to the automation of editorial tasks on the basis of the Dictionary database.

##Requirements
Essential technical requirements include experience in SQL relational databases, in XML processing with XSLT and XQuery, in web interface design, and in web‐server administration; familiarity with the eXist XML database system and experience in digital image processing and in digital typography using a TeX‐based system are desirable. Also essential is an interest and active participation in the field of Digital Humanities, in order to learn from the experiences of related projects, to effectively use their findings and tools, and to make the Dictionary of Gāndhārī a visible participant in this academic field; demonstrable experience in a successful Digital Humanities project will be an asset. Previous knowledge of Gāndhārī or other Indian languages is not required, but the programmer / digital humanist will be expected to acquire basic familiarity with the main linguistic and textual features of the Dictionary’s source material in the course of his work, in order to communicate effectively with colleagues and to make appropriate technical decisions informed by the nature of the source material. You have a graduate degree in Computer Science, Digital Humanities, Computer Linguistics or a comparable field of study. We look forward to applicants with a high degree of responsibility, good communicative abilities and personal motivation.

Your place of work is centrally located in Munich and can be easily reached by public transportation. We offer interesting and responsible work with excellent opportunities for further qualification and professional development as part of an international research team. Disabled applicants with equal qualification will be preferred. Women are encouraged to apply.

##Application Procedure
Interested candidates should submit the following documents by 31
August 2012:
* a curriculum vitae,
* copies of university degrees and other relevant qualifications,
* if applicable documentation of previous participation in a similar research project,
* the names and contact information of two referees.
