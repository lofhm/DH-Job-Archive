## Description

<p>To complement the University of Saskatchewan’s growing strengths in Digital Humanities, the Department of English is seeking applicants for a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in digital textuality. The Canada Research Chairs Program is part of a national strategy to make Canada one of the world's top countries for research and development. Tier 1 Canada Research Chairs are outstanding researchers acknowledged by their peers as world leaders in their fields and are funded at $200,000 annually for seven years, with additional funding available for infrastructure (www.chairs.gc.ca/web/home_e.asp). Potential candidates will be recognized leaders in the field of digital textuality who are prepared to take a central role in fostering this growing area of expertise within the College of Arts and Science. Applicants should have a PhD in English (or its equivalent) as well as a wide range of expertise in computer-based methods in humanities research with a particular focus on digital literature, its forms, and its social and cultural significance. The successful candidate will be a first-rate scholar and researcher, an experienced collaborator, and an active and successful grant writer. This competition is not restricted to Canadian citizens.</p>

<p>Over the last ten years the Department of English and others in the College of Arts and Science have gathered considerable momentum in the area of digital scholarship and have established the University of Saskatchewan in a growing network of Digital Humanities nodes in Canada, participating in TAPoR II (The Text Analysis Portal, a major CFI application for $21M) and INKE: Implementing New Knowledge Environments (involving an MCRI grant and other funding amounting to $13M now awarded). Locally the Digital Research Centre (drc.usask.ca), established in 2007, has provided a physical space for exchange of ideas, collaborative interactions, and scholarship amongst the DRC Users Group and ETRUS (Electronic Text Research at the U of S: etrus.usask.ca). There are several digital humanities projects underway, two of them with external funding. Several members of the College are active members in national and international digital humanities organizations, and we recently hosted the Society for Digital Humanities/Société pour l'étude des médias interactifs conference (2007) and CaSTA 2008 (the Canadian Symposium on Text Analysis). The proposed CRC in Digital Literature will help further to establish the University of Saskatchewan as a centre of new media research in Canada.</p>

<p>Applicants will be part of an internal competition between three university units for a single Canada Research Chair (see complete ad below). We strongly suggest that expressions of interest be directed to either Doug Thorpe (Head of the Department of English) doug.thorpe@usask.ca or Peter Stoicheff (Vice Dean of Humanities and Fine Arts) peter.stoicheff@usask.ca.</p>
