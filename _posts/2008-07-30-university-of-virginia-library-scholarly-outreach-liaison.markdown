## Description





<p>The University of Virginia Library seeks a creative, enterprising
person who can demonstrate a deep understanding of the intellectual
and technical scene of digital scholarship in the humanities and
social sciences to coordinate outreach to faculty and students
through the Scholars' Lab and to facilitate communication between the
Library's research and development staff and their scholarly
clientele. The successful candidate will design and implement
consultative services to address the needs of humanities and social
science scholars and will aggressively promote intellectual
programming and outreach activity in the Scholars' Lab.</p>

<p>The Scholars' Lab is located in Alderman Library and is a
collaborative venture between the UVA Library and ITC, the University
of Virginia's Information Technology and Communications division. The
Scholars' Lab combines the services of the former GeoStat and Etext
Centers and is designed to provide faculty and students in humanities
and social science disciplines with technology and guidance to
support their interpretive and scholarly work in geospatial,
statistical, and text-based computing. Research and Development is a
unit of the Library's Digital Research & Scholarship department
devoted to programming support for scholarly projects and interfaces.

student employees in support of this work as needed; and engage in
targeted and general outreach, including organization of the
Scholars' Lab's speaker series and luncheon talks and workshops and
of the Library's Graduate Fellows Program in Digital Humanities. The
Scholarly Outreach Liaison is further expected to engage in
instruction and professional development by offering workshops to
faculty, students, and staff, and publishing and presenting original
research in digital scholarship.</p>
