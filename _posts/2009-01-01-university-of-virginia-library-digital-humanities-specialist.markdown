## Description






<p>The University of Virginia Library seeks a technically-grounded,
visionary person with a deep understanding of scholarship in the
humanities and social sciences to shape the services of the Scholars'
Lab and Digital Scholarship R&D departments around text-based digital
humanities. The successful candidate will design and implement
technical services that sustain legacy content while supporting
current faculty development, are forward-looking to research trends
such as data mining, visualization, and social, semantic, and web

the digital humanities.</p>

<p>The Scholars' Lab is located in Alderman Library and is a
collaborative venture between the UVA Library and ITC, the University
of Virginia's Information Technology and Communications
division.  The Scholars' Lab combines the services of the former
GeoStat and Etext Centers and is designed to provide faculty and
students in humanities and social science disciplines with technology
and guidance to support their interpretive and scholarly work in
geospatial, statistical, and text-based computing. Research and
Development is a unit of the Library's Digital Research & Scholarship
department devoted to programming support for scholarly projects and
interfaces. Information about both groups can be accessed at

Scholarship R&D on the development of faculty projects with
significant textual components; pursue innovative solutions to
problems of ontology, markup, data mining, visualization, and
display; supervise XML/XSLT efforts by Scholars' Lab students
attached to faculty projects; create and offer training programs
related to text-based digital humanities, assist in ongoing corpus
management work related to resources developed by the former Etext
Center; and follow emerging standards and methods to ensure that UVA
Library practices keep pace in public service and technology support.
The Digital Humanities Specialist is further expected to engage
professionally in digital scholarship by publishing and presenting
original research or development work.</p>

position has general faculty status with excellent benefits,
