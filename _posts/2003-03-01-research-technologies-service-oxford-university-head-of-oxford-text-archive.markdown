## Description


<p>Grade: RS2</p>

<p>Salary: GBP 25,451 - 36,712</p>

<p>The Research Technologies Service (RTS), based at Oxford University Computing Services, brings together a number of local, national, and international initiatives focussing on the support of research and utilising leading-edge technologies. Its activities and strategy are described at www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/rts/.</p>

<p>The Oxford Text Archive (OTA) is a key component of the RTS. With substantial funding from the JISC and the AHRB, it hosts the AHDS Subject Centre for Literature Languages and Linguistics, which is part of the national Arts and Humanities Data Service (see ahds.ac.uk).</p>

<p>This is a senior post involving strategic development as well as day to day management. You will be expected to develop strategic aims and objectives, supervise staff, allocate resources, and to work closely with other components of the RTS, OUCS, and the University. You will be responsible for representing the OTA at every level, liaising with partners and stakeholders, and ensuring timely and cost effective delivery of its services.</p>

<p>We expect you to have a postgraduate qualification (or equivalent) in an appropriate discipline, with at least five years' relevant work experience. You will have a strategic knowledge of current developments and open standards in the creation, cataloguing, description, and archiving of digital resources. You will have experience of the creation and use of such resources within HE research and teaching, and you will be able to demonstrate the ability to work well with research and teaching staff at the local and national levels.</p>

<p>By playing a major role in the development of a key service within the RTS, you will contribute to the establishment of a unique research-support environment at a world class University.</p>

<p>Candidates should have a genuine enthusiasm for the creation and use of digital resources, and a willingness to work in a multi-disciplinary team.  Good time management and communication skills are essential.</p>
