## Description

The History Department at Rutgers-Camden seeks a full-time tenure-track faculty member at the rank of Assistant Professor, specialization open, with strengths in digital and public history.  Appointment will begin in September 2013. Applicants must have the Ph.D. degree in hand at time of appointment. The successful applicant will teach 2/2, including undergraduate and graduate courses in area of specialization, in a new curriculum in Digital Studies, and M.A. program in public history, and will be held to standards for tenure and promotion that are uniform for all Rutgers faculty. The department welcomes all qualified applicants, but is especially interested in scholars whose work advances the field of digital history (including archival or other public history applications) and engages with interdisciplinary campus initiatives. Rutgers-Camden is the southern campus of Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, and offers access to an AAU and Research 1 library system. The campus is directly across the Delaware River from the cultural and academic resources of Philadelphia, an active center of public history and technology innovation.

Application materials should include URL links to digital projects. Please send a letter of application, C.V., graduate transcripts, three signed letters of recommendation, and an article or chapter-length writing sample to: Digital/Public History Search Committee Chair Charlene Mires, History Department, Rutgers University, 429 Cooper Street, Camden, NJ 08102 or upload to a file-sharing service and send links to <cmires@camden.rutgers.edu>. If the writing sample is part of a larger study, please also send an abstract and a table of contents, and/or a statement of how the sample fits into the larger work.

Please submit all materials by December 1. Consideration of all applicants will begin immediately after the deadline; we will acknowledge all applications. Interviews will be conducted at the AHA meeting in New Orleans.
