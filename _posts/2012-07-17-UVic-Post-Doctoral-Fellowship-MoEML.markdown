## Description

The Map of Early Modern London (MoEML) project invites applications for a post-doctoral fellowship valued at $32,500 per year for up to two years. The successful applicant will be expected to join the project on site in Victoria, BC, and work closely with the project director, developers, and research assistants in the next phase of MoEML’s development. He or she will take a leading role in the ongoing identification of all the features of the Agas Map (Civitas Londinum); textual and critical work on the map; ongoing work on the encyclopedia of early modern streets and sites; and the editing, markup, annotation, and creation of a critical apparatus for a versioned edition of the 1598, 1603,1633, and modern texts of John Stow’s A Survey of London. The successful applicant will also be encouraged to work on related projects, to bring his or her particular research interests to MoEML, and to help shape MoEML’s future. Applicants need to have a strong background in the literature of early modern London, preferably in textual criticism, drama, chronicle histories, civic literature, pageantry, and/or the geohumanities. Facility with literary computing and some knowledge of TEI are essential. Experience with editing, historical or literary GIS, and databases is desirable.

MoEML is an established project with SSHRC funding and ongoing technical support from the Humanities Computing and Media Centre at the University of Victoria. MoEML is directed by Janelle Jenstad (Department of English, University of Victoria), and overseen by advisory and editorial boards. The summary from MoEML’s SSHRC Insight Grant can be found here.
The University of Victoria is committed to providing an environment that protects and promotes the human rights of all persons and affirms the dignity of all persons. MoEML is committed to honouring the Collaborators’ Bill of Rights.

Enquiries and applications may be sent to MoEML via Janelle Jenstad at <london@uvic.ca>. Electronic application packages should include a statement of relevant experience, a full CV, reference letters (or the names of referees), and links to the applicant’s projects and publications. All applications received by **17 July 2012** will be acknowledged. Interviews will be conducted via Skype the following week.
