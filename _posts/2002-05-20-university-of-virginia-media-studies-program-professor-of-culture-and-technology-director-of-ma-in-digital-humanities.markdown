## Description


<p>

The University of Virginia's newly established Media Studies Program seeks applicants for a senior, chaired Professor of Culture and Technology. We are seeking an energetic, imaginative, dedicated scholar and teacher with a commitment to expanding our understanding of the relations between culture and technology, preferably with an interest in digital media and information technology. Successful candidates should have a distinguished record of publication and teaching. This person will serve as Director of a Master's degree in Digital Humanities (beginning Fall 2002) and develop undergraduate courses in the area of culture, technology, and media from a disciplinary perspective (history, sociology, psychology, history of science, cultural studies, anthropology, literature, information science, philosophy, or other field). Teaching load is three courses per year (one course relief for tenure of Directorship, normal load is 2/2), with other responsibilities normally associated with a faculty appointment. All appointments in Media Studies have a tenure home in a discipline-based department, usually within the College of Arts and Sciences. Immediate review of applications will begin December 15, 2001 and continue until filled. Anticipated start date for the appointment is August 25, 2002.</p>

<p>Interested candidates should send a cover letter, resume, indication of teaching interests, list of references, and one representative publication to:</p>
