## Description









<p>The newly-created Carolina Digital Library (working title) is looking
for a programmer who will work primarily with UNC's institutional
repository, but also on other digital library initiatives as needed.
The new hire will have a lot of input in the planning and design of
this important new system, as well as it's development.  We need
someone who is interested in developing and working with complex
systems and has a passion for preserving and providing innovative
ways to access digital materials.</p>

<p>The position requires a thorough understanding of and familiarity
with relational databases, a strong grasp of object-oriented
programming and design, and an understanding of WWW programming,
including protocols like HTTP and markup languages. Applicants should
have experience with Java, especially servlet programming and XML
processing, SQL, and at least one other language such as C/C++, Ruby,
Python, PHP, or Perl.  Experience with XSLT, MySQL, XML databases,
information retrieval software (especially Lucene) institutional
repository software, Tomcat, metadata standards such as METS and
MODS, and the Text Encoding Initiative will be considered a plus.
Should be comfortable working in Linux and able to administer a Linux
workstation.</p>

<p>A second, similar, position will be advertised soon.  More details
and application procedures are at: <a href="https://s4.its.unc.edu/RAMS4/details.do?posID=0057419">https://s4.its.unc.edu/RAMS4/details.do?posID=0057419</a>

UNC's Digital Library is home to Documenting the American South
(http://docsouth.unc.edu) and other internationally recognized
digital humanities initiatives.  Programmers with digital humanities
backgrounds are especially welcome to apply.  I will be at the
Digital Humanities conference in Urbana-Champaign and will be happy
to talk to candidates there.</p>
