## Description



<p>The Division of Design in the School of Art at the University of Washington in Seattle seeks applicants for a full-time, tenure-track position in Interaction Design starting September 2005. We define interaction design as a discipline concerned with the design of technology-centered experiences: in interactive media, software, products and information spaces. It is an inherently cross-disciplinary field that incorporates concepts from design (industrial design, visual communication design, and architecture) computer science, and the social sciences (cognitive psychology, informatics, and communication). Additionally, the faculty member will contribute to teaching within common lower-division courses and in the graduate program. As such, he/she must be capable of collaborating across multiple design disciplines.</p>

<p>This position will establish interaction design within the Division of Design and will contribute to a series of interdisciplinary courses that include students from visual communication design, industrial design, computer science, informatics and others. Additionally, the faculty member will contribute to teaching within common lower-division courses and in the graduate program. As such, he/she must be capable of collaborating across multiple design disciplines. The University of Washington is committed to building a culturally diverse faculty and strongly encourages applications from female and minority candidates. The University of Washington is an Equal Opportunity/ Affirmative Action employer. AA/EOE.</p>
