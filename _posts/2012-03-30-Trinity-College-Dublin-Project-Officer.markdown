## General Project Information
The CENDARI Project is a four-year project funded by the European Commission to integrate digital archival resources for medieval and modern history.  The project will be delivered by a consortium of 14 partners from across Europe, including Ireland, the UK, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic and Serbia.  The project has an overall budget of €6.5M, and is coordinated by Trinity College Dublin. 

CENDARI involves a broad collaboration between historians, research infrastructures, and technical experts, many of whom have already been working toward the consolidation of ehumanities infrastructure in the context of DARIAH, the EU’s Digital Research Infrastructure for 
the Arts and Humanities. All are contributing building blocks to the construction of the CENDARI 
enquiry environment, an innovative system that will change the way we view historical research. 
The platform will provide centralised access to previously fragmented European information 
resources, such as archives and libraries. The advent of digitisation programmes already 
enables scholars to access extensive collections online, but in CENDARI, the emphasis will be 
on drawing together material, from disparate sources and in various digital formats, into a 
consolidated bespoke environment for research.

Building digital bridges between highly dispersed archives and collections is, however, merely the starting point for the partners’ joint endeavour. The new platform will be equipped to support transnational and comparative approaches across disciplines, locations and modalities of scholarship, creating a space where key aspects of our shared history can be placed in a truly European context. As one of two case studies selected for the purposes of the development, the team will approach an area of study where the fragmentation of sources has been particularly problematic: research into the First World War, a pan-European event which remains insufficiently explored as such.  
Powerful tools and services will underpin this interactive search environment. Proposed functionalities include multilingual search operations across heterogeneous data sets, indexes of named entities (people, places or events), personalisation features, shared research and teaching spaces, and annotation trails inviting users to add intelligence to the system. Other activities will focus on introducingnew paradigms for the exploration of patterns and on developing applications that will use a visual and semantic palette to highlight geopolitical changes, as reflected in shifting borders, the emergence and decline of communities and political entities, and the related linguistic, cultural and economic realignments. These functionalities are of particular interest for studies into periods of rapid change, such as the First World War. The project’s second case study, dedicated to creating an atlas of medieval culture, will also draw heavily on these advanced features. 

The project will be based in the Trinity Long Room Hub, Trinity College Dublin’s Research Institute for the arts and humanities, and make it’s home in the Hub’s signature facility on historic Fellow’s Square.

## Trinity College Dublin 
Founded in 1592, Trinity College Dublin is the oldest university in Ireland and one of the older universities of Western Europe. On today’s campus, state-of-the-art libraries, laboratories and IT facilities, stand alongside historic buildings on a city-centre 47-acre campus.

Trinity College Dublin offers a unique educational experience across a range of disciplines in the arts, humanities, engineering, science, human, social and health sciences. As Ireland’s premier university, the pursuit of excellence through research and scholarship is at the heart of a Trinity education. TCD has an outstanding record of publications in high-impact journals, and a track 
record in winning research funding which is among the best in the country.

TCD has developed significant  strength in a broad range of research areas including the 18 broadly-based multi-disciplinary thematic research areas listed below.

Sustainable Environment, Next Generation Medical Devices, Human Condition, Smart and Sustainable, Cities, Creative Technologies - Digital Media Arts and Entertainment, International, Development, Cancer, Neuroscience, Immunology and Infection, Nanoscience, Telecommunications, Cultural Heritage & Arts, Sustainable Society, Human and Social, Networking, Ageing, International Integration, Digital Humanities

Its current flagship interdisciplinary research institutes are in areas such as molecular medicine, neuroscience, international integration studies, nanostructures and nanodevices. The construction of Ireland’s first purpose built nanoscience research institute, CRANN, was opened in January 2008, which houses 150 scientists, technicians and graduate students in specialised 
laboratory facilities.

The building also includes an innovative public venue, the Science Gallery.   In 2011, it received the Shorty Award for Best Cultural Institution on Twitter globally and the Irish Web Award for Best Education and Third Level Website. These joined a list of awards that includes European Museum of the Year Award – Special Commendation 2010 and National IT award for best use of technology in education, 2009. In 2012, during Dublin's tenure as European City of Science, Science Gallery will continue to develop inspiring new exhibitions and experiences.

The recently opened Trinity  Biomedical Sciences Institute (TBSI) is an unprecedented development for Biomedical Research in Ireland, both in terms of scale and ambition.  It provides a facility for TCD to continue its upward trajectory in both basic and translational 
research programmes, notably in the areas of Immunology, Cancer and Medical Devices.

The Library of Trinity College is the largest research library in Ireland and is an invaluable resource to scholars. In addition to purchases and donations accrued over four centuries, the College has had 200 years of legal deposit. By this right Trinity can claim a copy of every book published in Ireland the UK.  The Library has over 4.25 million books, 22,000 printed periodical titles and access to 60,000 e-journals and 250,000 e-books. The Library’s research resources also include internationally significant holdings in manuscripts (the most famous being the Book of Kells), early printed material and maps. Its collections and services support the College’s research and teaching community of 15,000+ students and academic staff.

Trinity continues to attract intellectually strong students from Ireland and abroad. More than half of its incoming undergraduates have earned in excess of 500 out of a maximum 600 points in the national Leaving Certificate examination. The accessibility of a Trinity education to all students of ability is also very important. Trinity College was the first university in Ireland to 
reserve 15% of first year undergraduate places for students from non-traditional learning groups – students with a disability, socio-economically disadvantaged students as well as mature students. The College has met its target in this respect. There is also an exciting international mix of its student body where  16% of students are from outside Ireland and 40% of these students are from outside the European Union. TCD students also have an opportunity to study abroad in other leading European universities through Trinity’s partnership agreements.

Students also benefit from a scholar teacher model where they have the opportunity of being taught by world-leading experts in their field. Interdisciplinarity forms a key element in the College strategy in increasing Trinity’s international standing as a research-led university. Many of Trinity College Dublin’s alumni have helped shape the history of Ireland and Western Europe. They include author, Jonathan Swift, philosopher,  George Berkeley, political philosopher, Edmund Burke, wit and dramatist, Oscar Wilde, historian, William Lecky, religious scholar, James Ussher, scientists, John Joly, George Johnstone Stoney, William Rowan Hamilton and physicians, William Stokes and Denis Burkitt. 

Two of Trinity College’s alumni have won Nobel prizes – Ernest Walton for Physics in 1951 and Samuel Beckett for Literature in 1968. The first President of Ireland, Douglas Hyde was a graduate as was the first female President of Ireland, Mary Robinson.
