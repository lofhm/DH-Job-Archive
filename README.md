### Help decide how to store this data

In addition to copy/pasting the text of ads into txt files, is it worthwhile to provide some standard metadata for each? if so, what is that? what file naming scheme should we adopt? We need to figure this out before adding too many listings.

### Adding job listings to the repository
1. Fork the repository
2. Commit a job listing using an agreed upon file structure (see above)
3. Initiate a pull request so we can integrate your listing into the main repository.
